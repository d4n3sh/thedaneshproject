Browsing speed is advertised to be up to 20Mbps and 128kbps when your quota is reached.

I've been on the prepaid packages for a few months now, It's reliable ðŸ™‚ but running out of credit while on the road sucks. I'm looking forward to going postpaid and I guess most prepaid users might feel the same too.
