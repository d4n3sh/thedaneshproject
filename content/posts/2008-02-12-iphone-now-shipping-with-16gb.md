With over 4 million units sold Apple has decided to release an upgrade to the popular iPhone. The iPhone now comes with 8GB or 16GB of storage. The new 16GB model will run you USD499 whereas the 8GB model will be USD399.

The iPod touch also received aÃ‚Â  bump upÃ‚Â  in it&#8217;s storage area.Ã‚Â  Apple has started shipping it with 8GB, 16GB and now also 32GB. The 32GB model is priced at USD499, USD399 for the 16GB model and USD299 for the 8GB model.

I am really looking to get the iPod Touch soon. Might pick up the 32GB model.
