WordPress 2.5 missed it's initial release date but not for a bad reason. There's quite a bit of work being put into the new version especially in the dashboard area.

The editor is receiving a much needed face lift and feature boost. The media manager now supports multiple uploads like flickr and support for embedding videos is being added as a standard feature.

Other new features include a image gallery, faster load times, gravatar support, one-click plugin upgrades, full text feeds and improved tags management.

There's a screencast of 2.5 rc2 available for you to get a glimpse of what in 2.5. [Watch it here][1].

Looking good eh?
