With the recent [internet issues][1], byte craft's local Ubuntu mirror was not being up2date due to overlapping cron jobs.

They have since moved to [ubumirror][2] running on apache/ngix and all seems good. Releases are on a 3 hour sync and archives 4Â  hours sync.

Grab your CD images [HERE][3].Enjoy the speed.
