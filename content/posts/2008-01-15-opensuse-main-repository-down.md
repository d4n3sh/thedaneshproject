The main openSUSE repositories have been down for about 12 hours now due to hardware failures. If you are using these mirrors then your package manager would most likely fail as mine did. Screen shots below.

_**So what do you do?**_

It&#8217;s advisable to use a mirror closer to your location. I use Japan. The performance is better when compared with the other Asian mirros.

For the full list of mirrors go to the openSUSE Wiki
