How many times have you had a site fail to load for you but work fine for your friends? I've had this happen to me numeros times with youtube,flickr,google and many other sites.

Here's a cool tool by Twitter developer Alex Payne name appropriately [downforeveryoneorjustme][2]. The site's self-explanatory, punch in the URL in fault and your get your answer.

This is a must have tool for me now. What ya think?
