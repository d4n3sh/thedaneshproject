Facebook has always used random numbers to make up your profile page URL. This is not longer the case, with the introduction of [Facebook usernames][2], you can now have your name in the URL instead of the random numbers.

See [mine][3] below.

Go to the <http://www.facebook.com/username/> page and set you desired username. That's all, now share your new easy to read profile.
