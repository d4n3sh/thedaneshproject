I finally upgraded to WordPress version 2.3.2.

Been really tired and busy since coming back from [Langkawi][1] last week. Found some time last night so this was the first thing I did.

WordPress 2.3.2 is a security release which fixes a hole that allows attackers to access your [drafts][2] and also attain your database structure information through [error messages][3].

Better patch up quick!!
