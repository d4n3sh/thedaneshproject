Received my Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy Heron cds in the mail today.

Who doesn&#8217;t like to receive internatioanl packages with goodies? The best part is when I tell my non OSSÃ‚Â  friends that the cds were shipped free of charge.

You will be suprised to know that many people don&#8217;t believe that there are people out there providing wonderfull services not for money but out of passion. Welcome to the world of opensource is what I normally my response would be to them.

Go Go OSS!!

Anyways, if you want your own Ubuntu cd, go to Ubuntu&#8217;s [ShipIt][1] page and place your order. Remember, it&#8217;s a free service so don&#8217;t expect speedy delivery unless your are willing to pay.
