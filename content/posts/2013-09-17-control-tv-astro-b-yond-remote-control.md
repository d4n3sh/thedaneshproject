Finally configured my B.yond remote to control my TV.

There are are 2 ways to configure your remote.

Method 1:

  1. Hold down the **tv**(power)  and power buttons together  until the indicator blinks twice.
  2. Refer to the table below and key in the 4 digit number that represents your TV brand.
  3. If the code was valid the indicator will blink twice again.
  4. Press the **tv**(power) button, if your TV turns off then the code worked else repeat the steps and try another code from the table.

Method 2:

  1. Hold down the **tv**(power)  and power buttons together  until the indicator blinks twice.
  2. Key in 9 - 9 - 1. The indicator should blink twice again.
  3. Press the **tv**(power) button, aim the remote at the decoder and press the **ch+**(channel up) button.
  4. Wait 3 seconds. If the TV does not turn off, press the  **ch+**(channel up) button and wait for 3 seconds again. Repeat the steps until the TV turns off.  You're basically iterating through the TV codes in the remote's database.
  5. Press the OK button once you find the correct code.
