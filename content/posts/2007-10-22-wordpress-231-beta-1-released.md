The first maintenance release for WordPress 2.3(Dexter) was released a few days back. [WordPress 2.3.1][1].

This release covers over 20 bugs. The list of bugs fixed can be viewed [here][2].

>   1. Tagging support for Windows Live Writer
>   2. A login bug that affected those with a Blog Address different than
>   3. their WordPress Address is fixed
>   4. Faster taxonomy database queries, especially tag intersection queries
>   5. Link importer fixes

The Danesh Project is running 2.2.3 as I have not found a good reason to upgrade yet. Maybe in a month or so. For now I have it running on my Dev machines at home.

How's your experience been with Dexter?
