There wasÃ‚Â  scheduled maintenance workÃ‚Â  carried out on the servers hosting The DaneshÃ‚Â  Project these past 2 days.Ã‚Â  The servers were gettingÃ‚Â  new IPs and better infrastructure.

The outage was planned for the 22nd but somehow the hosting guys got the notification mails mixed up which explains why you did not see a post from me regarding the outage beforehand. The notification mail's subject line read 22nd but the mail body stated 23rd.Ã‚Â  My mind was set on the 23rd. See below.

Well, I guess it was a genuine mistake that I would have made myself under pressure but what got to me was the 30hours outage that was initialy suppsed to only be 5-10hours. Apparently the DNS servers were propagating slower then expected.

Good thing is the site's back up with improved performance now and I have my smile back.
