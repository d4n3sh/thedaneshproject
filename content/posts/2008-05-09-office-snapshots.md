[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-543" title="Googleplex" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/gp5-500x357.jpg" alt="Googleplex" width="500" height="357" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/gp5-500x357.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/05/gp5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />][1]

That's the famous Googleplex. A place many dream to work at.

But why? Is it their brilliant ideas or os it the alternative office workspace that Google practices? Either way I would love to work for them someday.

Today, Google is not longer the pioneer in alternative office workspaces, familiar companies like Facebook, Flickr, Mozilla, LinkedIn and many others are coming up with impressive office workspaces too to bring out the best in their employees.

If you need a glimpse of what these offices look like, [Office Snapshots][2] has an impressive collection of snapshots of workspaces

Trust me, after looking at them. What we have in Malaysia feels like a factory. Seriously.
