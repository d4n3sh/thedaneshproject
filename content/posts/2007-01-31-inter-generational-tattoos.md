Awesome picture.

The photograph was taken by photographer Bruce Osborn during an interview about inter-generational tattoos.

<span class="rss:item"></span><a name="032560"></a> â€œHer parents were tattooists and the girl got a huge shock when she entered a sent?, a public bath, for the first time. Until that event it was in her mind that all the adults must have tattoos. Everybody around the house had some and it was a very natural thing for her.â€ words from Bruce.

My parents would freak out on this.... but I think the idea will eventually start to sink in. The girl sends out a power message.
