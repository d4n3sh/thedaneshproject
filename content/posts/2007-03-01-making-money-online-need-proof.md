I came across _"[Cheques Gallery][1]"_ a few days back. The blog has a good collection of images of cheques and notes from contributors who have been successfully making money online through their blogs or other content. Going through the site and looking at all the various <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">$$</span> signs or <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">bling</span> as I call it got me all fired up to start blogging quality content and not just mambo jumbo.

I must say, it is really nice to see a good collection of Malaysian bloggers getting rewarded for their thoughts and contents. Just look at all the "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">bling</span>" they making.

The _"[Cheques Gallery][1]"_ is good eye opener and motivator to all those seriously thinking of contributing to the blogging scene. Have a look and tell me your self.
