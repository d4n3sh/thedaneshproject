You thought it will never happens to you but when it does are you prepared?

HongKiat.com was defaced yesterday. He lost his database and 2-3 days of posts.

**Hong Kiat's Fix:**

1. Upgrade to [WordPress 2.2.1][2]

2. Restore the backup of the database. He was lucky to have one.

I visit Hong Kiat.comÂ  almost everyday, his posts are quite good. It's to know that he is back online.

**Lesson to learn:**

Make sure to always upgrade when a security patch is released. We don't live in a perfect world anymore where people are nice and decent. Your best friend is prevention.
