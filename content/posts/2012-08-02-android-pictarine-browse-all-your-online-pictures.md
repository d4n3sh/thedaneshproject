There's a new photo feed app out today  from Pictarine for the Android.

Pictarine pulls photos from  all your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr and tumblr. It then presents the photos to you in a nice feed where you can like, comment or share those pictures. All you need is a Google or Facebook account, connect and the app does the rest.

Features:

  *  Connect Pictarine up to 11 social networks, streamlining photos and activities like commenting, liking and sharing.
  *  Rediscover your memories through a choice of the photos that matter most to you. You will be surprised! (my favourite feature)
  *  Get photos from all of your services in your pocket, so they are always one touch away.
  *  Bookmark your favourite photos in playlists
  *  Works with Android versions 2.2 and above

Grab it from Google Play.
