Upgraded to WordPress 2.6.1 today. Not a security release so no need to update if you're happy with 2.6. [Read the change log.][2]

Tried out the WordPress Automatic Upgrade plugin today (WPAU). A few scares with directory permissions as usual, but besides that, the upgrade was a success.

Download WPAU here.
