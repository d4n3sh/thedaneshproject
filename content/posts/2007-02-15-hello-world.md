Yup, Hello world again. This time it is final.

I decided to move "TheDaneshProject Tech Blog" up a level to just "TheDaneshProject". It's easier to remember and seems to be stronger brand name I think. Don't youÂ  agree?

I am concentrating more on Linux related reads, general tech and also my passion for tattoos and piercings. This time I am going to try publishing as much information as I can get my hands on from the local scene here in Malaysia. Tattoos and piercings in Malaysia will also be my major direction.

Currently I am working on moving over my old articles from "TheDaneshProject Tech Blog" to this blog. Having some issues with the images and comments but I think I'll have it completed by the weekend.

Stay tuned guys&#8230;..

"TheDaneshProject", "share your mind".
