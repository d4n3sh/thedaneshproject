Pete Teo's latest project, [15Malaysia][1] went live yesterday.

15Malaysia is a local project consisting of 15 short films from 15 local filmmakers. The short films are about Malaysians and cover the social-politics issues in Malaysia with a twist of humor. The cast members are made up of famous actors, musicians and political leaders so you'll be entertained for sure.

The films will be released in batches from 17th August to 16th September. 3 movies a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If you wondered why 16th September, it's Malaysia day.

Here's the first short film by [Ho YuHang][2] titled "[Potong Saga][3]". A laugh-out-loud film about a Chinese boyâ€™s misguided attempts at opening an Islamic bank account.



What do you thing? Will Malaysians like what the see?
