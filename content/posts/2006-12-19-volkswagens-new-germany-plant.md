Look at this parking lot!!! Don't you wish we had one at each mall? I imagine the work a robber would have to put in just to get into your car&#8230;haha

But anyway, this image is actually VW's storage facility for it's complted cars in it's Germany plant.

Benefits;  
1. Cheaper.  
2. You get your car in lesser time.  
3. Only consumes 20% of the space needed to build a traditional storage facility.  
4. No damages to your vehicle.
