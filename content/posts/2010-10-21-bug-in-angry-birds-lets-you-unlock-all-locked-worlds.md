The guys behind Angry Birds for Android decided to include a small easter egg / trick that unlocked all the locked worlds.

I've completed the game on my iPhone so I decided to give this a try and it worked like a charm!!

Here's how you unlock all worlds.<!--more-->

1. Launch Angry Birds and go to the world select screen.  
2. Select a locked world on the screen. ( The one with a pad-lock ðŸ˜€ )  
3. Hit back button all the way out of Angry Birds.  
4. Launch Angry Birds again and when the &#8220;Play&#8221; button appears, keep taping it till you get into your locked world.  
5. If step 4 worked, you should now be inside the locked worlds stage select screen.  
6. REMEMBER!! To keep it unlocked just pass the first world level of each locked world.

Enjoy ðŸ˜€
