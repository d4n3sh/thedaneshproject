openSUSE's mailingÃ‚Â  list, download redirector, build services are down due to a power outage at their datacenter in NÃƒÂ¼rnberg, Germany.

Restoration work is in motion but it it's going to take a few hours to complete. [Check status here][2].

See some photos from the work site. [Markojung][3] || Beineri

As a workaround use the mirrors. I'm on <http://mirror.oscc.org.my/> . Find a mirror closer to you.
