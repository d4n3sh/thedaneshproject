If you&#8217;re planning to cash out your fuel rebate soon at the post office, you&#8217;ll need to complete the rebate form.

Vehicle owners are looking at rebates not more then RM625 for cars and RM150 for motor motorcycles. [Read more][3]

A friend forwarded the form to me. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a head start for you.

Download the [rebate form][4] and [guidelines][5].
