[GScrot][1] is a powerful screen capture tool for Linux. The project went through a re-branding exercise earlier this month and now takes on a new, more appropriate name, "Shutter".

The project'sÂ  launchpad project name together with it's PPA have also been renamed to Shutter.

The new project page : <https://launchpad.net/shutter>

The new PPA : <https://launchpad.net/%7Eshutter/+archive/ppa>

For those currently running GScrot, please update your sources to reflect the new "shutter" repository.
