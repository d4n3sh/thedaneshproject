Thought it would be interesting to find out how people name their computers. I've always used names as they help me identify servers easier.

My computers;

1. My Linux Notebook is &#8220;Pandora&#8221;. Weapon of mass destruction.

2. My ipCOP server is now &#8220;angel&#8221;. It used to be &#8220;vagina&#8221;, not the best name when you stay with your family.

3. My Linux Desktop is named &#8220;bespin&#8221;.

4. My file/web server goes by &#8220;nosebleed&#8221; because some content on it will give you a nosebleed.

5. My WinXP desktop goes by &#8220;junk&#8221;. Need I say more?

6. My office notebook goes by abubu. I have not idea why I chose that name.

So tell me, how to you name your computers?
