SIRIM's site has been exploited with malware. The compromised URL is &#8220;www.sirim.my/pop_event2.asp?id=685&#8221;. The URL when accessed downloads malicious software and infects the client PC. If I were you I would not access that link.

From what I know many Malaysian sites are still susceptible to cross side scripting and SQL injection attacks. Chances are this is what happened this time.

Google has already picked this up and is currently warning users about the threat. [Google Advisory][2]
