Can you control you TV volume from your Astro B.yond remote control?

I could turn on/off my TV using my Astro remote, but the volume needed a few extra steps to get working.

  1. Make sure you can turn on/off your TV from your Astro remote. Follow my [guide][2] if you can't.
  2. Make sure your Astro decoder volume is full and your TV volume is low.
  3. Press the **OK** and **Vol+**(volume up) button together until the indicator blinks twice.
  4. Press the **Vol+**(volume up) button. If your volume increases the everything went well.
