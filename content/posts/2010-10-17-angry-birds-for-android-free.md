The full version of Angry Birds is now available for the Android. It's free and supported by Ads. 

For those it rather not have ads, the Ad free version will be launched soon and would most likely be $1 like on the iPhone.

I've already completed the game on my iPhone, looks like round 2 on the Android now ðŸ˜€
