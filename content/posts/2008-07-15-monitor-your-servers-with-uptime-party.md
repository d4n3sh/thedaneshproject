[Uptime Party][2] is new web service to monitor your servers and their services. The service went public about 2 weeks back.

Services currently monitored are Web, Ping, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP and SSH. Servers and services are checked every hour(free account) and notification mails are sent out to keep you updated.

The monitoring service is free for 1 server, anything more and you'll need to pay.

  * 10 servers for $9.99/month, checked every 15 minutes
  * 5 servers for $4.99/month, checked every 30 minutes
  * 1 server for free, checked every 60 minutes

I had a short mail interview with the guys behind Uptime Party, here what they had to say about the service.

> We basically created Uptime Party for our own server monitoring needs, and later adapted it into a public product. Our main goal is keep things as simple as possible. We don't plan to add complex (and expensive) features that 90% of our users won't need.
> 
> We're hoping to target small businesses,Ã‚Â  especially small web development shops that have many client sites to monitor.
> 
> We just launched last week, so we're still getting things polished. Any suggestions would be welcome!
