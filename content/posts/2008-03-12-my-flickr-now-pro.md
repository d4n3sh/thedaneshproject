I finally decided to go ahead and upgrade my Flickr account from basic(free) to pro.

<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2328153839_80c4345304.jpg?v=1205323413" height="375" width="500" /> 

Cost me USD24.95 but was worth every penny. Unlimited space/sets/bandwidth/etc... and now since Picnik has also gone free it just made sense to dump my other image hosting sites and consolidate everything into Flickr moving forward.

If you need image hosting they are many other there to choose from. Take them for a spin and look at your requirements. Most times the basic/free services will be more then enough.
