T-Mobile today officially announed it new smart phone G1 which is powered by Google Android. Watch the webcast

It might not look as cool as the iPhone but from a application standpoint it's a whole different story.

Android market being an open market place for [Android Apps][1] will anyone to publish their apps and users will be able to choose what apps they want to install and run.

Here's G1's specs;

Size: 4.6 x 2.16 x 0.63 in (117 x 55 x 16 mm)  
Weight: 5.6 oz (159 g)

Talk Time: 5 hours  
Standby Time: 130 hours

From what I've gathered G1 will start out at USD 176 and 25USD-35USD for the plans.
