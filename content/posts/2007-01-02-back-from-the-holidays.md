Just got back from my holidays. No much happening this year. New year was pretty boring as I did not get to spend it with me close friends and family as I was stuck in Penang. But I did have a small party with my work buddies at the beach with minimal alcohol. ha.. ha&#8230;  
No regrets though, I finally had my much needed rest. Imagine getting 12 &#8211; 15 hours of sleep a day for a whole week. That will certainly get you recharged. I&#8217;ll start posting ASAP.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Make sure to honor your new year resolutions. I&#8217;m gonna try to quit smoking and make more money. Let&#8217;s see how it goes and I&#8217;ll make sure to keep you updated on my progress.

Adios till then&#8230;..
