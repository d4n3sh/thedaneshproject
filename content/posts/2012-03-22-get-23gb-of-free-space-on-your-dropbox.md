Here's how to get an extra 23GB added to your DropBox account.

**Remember!!**, this might not be legit so proceed at your own risk. Not sure how Dropbox's going to react to this. They might remove the extra space or ban your account.

Step 1: If you already have Dropbox installed on your Android device, you must Clear data, Force close and uninstall it from Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> Dropbox.

Step 2: Download and install the Dropbox+23GB APK [[Dropbox Link][2]Â || [MediaFire Link][3]].

Don't forget to enable Unknown sources under Settings -> Applications or Settings -> Security (on ICS) before installing the APK.

Step 3: Launch the app as usual and log in. Upload and download a few files.

Step 4: Wait for the confirmation email. Might take up to an hour in some cases.

Step 5: Uninstall the app and reinstall the official app from [Google Play][4].

ThanksÂ [theos0o][5] for this great gift. ðŸ˜€
