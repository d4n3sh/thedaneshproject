Just finished updating to WordPress 2.6 today. Here's a few features which caught my extension.

  * There's a new recycle bin feature now called "trash". You get to undelete posts, you get the idea.
  * There's a new built in image editor. You can crop,flip,scale any image you upload.
  * Batch plugin updates. Finally, you get to update all your outdated plugins in one go.
  * [Oembed][1], embed videos directly into posts now without the need for extra plugins. Just paste your video's url and wordpress will automatically embed it into your post.

For the full list read Matt's post on [WordPress 2.9][2].
