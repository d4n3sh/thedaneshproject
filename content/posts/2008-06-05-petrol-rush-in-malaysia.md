This was the scene at the petrol kiosk near my housing estate in Cheras.

I did not fuel up and so did many of my friends. We tried our luck at kiosks around but all of them had piles of cars waiting to fuel up. It just wasn&#8217;t worth it.

Waiting in line for hours just to save 30 bucks is not me. I&#8217;m gonna eventually have to follow the new increased price moving forward so instead, I decided to not smoke for 3 days to cover my loses.

Think green for nature and your pocket. I know many don&#8217;t agree with me on this but this is just my opinion.
