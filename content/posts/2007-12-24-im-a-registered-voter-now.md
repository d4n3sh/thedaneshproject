Finally today I decided to register myself as a voter for my country, Malaysia. Register at the Post office in KLCC during lunch.

Things need to change and the only way to get the ball rolling is by registering yourself as a voter and voting for who you believe(hope) in. Even if you don't vote, that will still send a message out saying you are not happy with the choice.

Please register as a voter as it's your duty as a citizen. 5mins at the nearest post office is not that much to ask now is it?

Don't bitch and whine if you not gonna at least register cause nothing will change and also don't hope for othes to do the work for you. Believe in what you want and go for it.
