I'm running Spotify version¬†0.9.4.183-1 and ¬†local mp3 files don't play anymore.

All I get from the logs is "15:58:39.156 I [audio\_driver\_linux.cpp:18 ] Using PulseAudio", no proper error message üôÅ

After some googling, the fix was simple enough. Install the "ffmpeg-compat" package from the office repo.

`sudo pacman -S ffmpeg-compat`

Restart spotify and your local mp3 files should now play in your Spotify client.
