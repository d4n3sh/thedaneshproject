My uncle suffered a stroke recently. It ain't pleasant, I can tell you that.

When someone is experiencing a stroke, time becomes their worst enemy. With every passing second, brain cells die and more of their bodily functions start to degrade. The faster one can identify a stroke and react, lesser the damage to the patient.

To identify if someone's having a stroke, do the following;

1. FACE &#8211; Ask them to smile. Is their face sagging? Are the facial muscles working?

2. ARM &#8211; Ask them to lift their arms. They might not be able to lift an arm.

3. SPEECH &#8211; Have a simple conversation with them. Get them to repeat simple sentences. They might have trouble doing that.

4. TIME &#8211; Don't waste time!! Call 911 or in our case 999.
