Malaysia finally gets it first GPS based taxi booking service, Unicablink. Its part of the Sunlight  Taxi group of companies.

You have 3 ways to book a cab. Call the call center at 1300-800-222, [book online][1] or through the mobile app. The mobile app is the best way and is available for both the Android and iPhone.

When a booking is made,  the nearest taxis will be notified and they can then bid on the job. Just like the cabs in SG. The company claims booking time has dropped from 20 minutes to only 5 minutes.

The next phase will be to introduce alternative payment methods. Credit / Debit cards and Touch n Go. This is something many of us are waiting for! Especially travelers.

Go grab the app on [Google Play][2] or the [AppStore][3] and take it for a spin.

What about [Taxi Monger][4] you ask? If I'm not wrong, that's sms based and the response time is slightly longer.

I've yet to book a cab through Unicablink, hopefully soon. Have you tried Unicablink yet?
