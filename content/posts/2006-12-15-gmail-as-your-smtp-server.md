Google offers a portable SMTP server(freebie) to send mail from any network to any email address provided you have a [Gmail][1] Account.

This is how your get it setup;

1. In your mail applications set the SMTP server for outgoing mail to smtp.google.com .  
2. Make sure username and password options are checked. Input your username [yourgmailname]@gmail.com.  
3. Check off "TLS" under "Use secure connection".

Hope it works for you.
