Ubuntu has chosen September to be it's "Month Of Screencasts" for this year.

One full length screencast will be release everyday by the [ScreencastTeam][3] for the whole month. A wide range of topics will be covered but mainly focusing at improving the user experience for new Ubuntu users or those looking to get into Ubuntu.

All approved screencasts will be made available to the public through the [Ubuntu Screencast site][4] in 3 different sizes, 2 formats (OGG and Flash) and an audio only version.

HowTo videos are always a new user's best friend. What do you think?
