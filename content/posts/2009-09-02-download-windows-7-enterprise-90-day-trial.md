Wanna take Windows 7 for a spin?

Microsoft has made available a 90 days trial version free of charge. Both 32bits and 64bits versions available for download and it's not he RC but the actual RTM version that will eventually hit store shelves soon.

Download it, try it and tell me what ya think?

The ISO is 2.24GB so it's gonna take some time to download.
