Lively is Google's answer to [Second Life][1]. An online 3D social network which allows users to interact with each other and their surroundings. Build your avatar, choose and room and you are ready to mingle.

Second Life has been around for a few years now, it's going to be interesting to see how Lively competes with the big boy.

[See Lively in action][2].
