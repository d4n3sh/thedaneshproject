Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) has been officially released today.

I have been running the beta version for about 2 weeks now where I managed to test [Ubuntu][1], [Kubuntu][2] and [Xubuntu][3]. There seems to be a good amount of improvements in the user experience arena. This can be best seen through the new integrated ability to simply install support for restricted formats like mp3 and DVD media. Kudos!! My pick is Xubuntu as it is the slimmest.

I also like the fact that the new CDs are now being shipped as live CDs. This puts the ball back into the users court enabling them to test run before committing.

There are 3 ways to obtain the latest Ubuntu distribution. You could [download][4], [buy online][5] or request for the CDs to be shipped to you for free via [shipit][6].

The download servers may be overloaded due to increased download requests so don't expect good speeds. [Ubuntu 7.04 download page.][4]

I would suggest going with the torrent way to get better download speeds. [Ubuntu 7.04 torrent files.][7]

I have already started my torrents for Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xbuntu
