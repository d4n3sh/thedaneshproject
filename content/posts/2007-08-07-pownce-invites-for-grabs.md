_ **What is Pownce?**_

[Pownce][3] is the latest tool to come from the creator of the Digg. Kevin Rose(The kid who made 60million in 18months). It&#8217;s a social-networking and micro blogging tool. Pownce let&#8217;s you share messages, links, events and files with those who are within your friends circle in Pownce.

The free version has a 10MB file size limit whereas the pro version is priced at USD20/year and 100MB file size limit.

Pownce accounts are currently by invite only. [Praveen Rajan][4] was kind enough to share an invite with me so now it&#8217;s my turn to spread the love.

I have 4 invites for from my Pownce account left. If you are interested please drop me a comment and a link back to you site/blog and I will send you an invite within a day or so.

Edit 1 : I am currently out of invites. Sorry
