Yup, you read that right.

Big boy Microsoft  submitted 20,000 lines of code to the Linux kernel community for review and inclusion into the Linux kernel tree. All under the GPLv2 license.

The code, made up of 3 Linux drivers will  enable all flavours for Linux to run on Windows 2008 through it's Hyper-V hypervisor technology. Providing better cross platform/vendor support and performance gains.

Well, I guess even the giant now realises that it's time to come out and share. Doing it alone doesn't quite work any more. The community really does have a voice that gets heard!

It's going to be interesting to see the community's response to this thou. There's going be mixed feelings for sure. The haters vs the lovers.

From my point of view, this move will take Linux deeper into the enterprise arena. Organisations that were once pro Windows will now have more options that directly enable them to support and run more applications on different platforms.

What do you think?
