Seen any weird names on food products lately. Check out what my colleague Elvin found in Tesco yesterday.

Had your laugh? I did.

Ok, now the truth. Spotted Dick is actually a dessert. It's a steamed pudding with dried fruits made popular in the UK. The popular dessert also goes by other names. Spotted Dog, Plum Duff, Figgy Dowdy, Plum Bolster and Spotted Richard.
