Streamyx got smart and officially fucked it's customers!!

We can't complain about slow international access any more as streamyx's new TOS clearly states that speedy access is only guaranteed for local content access.

> Quoted from Streamyx;
> 
> Streamyx download and upload speed is guaranteed for local content access only.  
> TM is not responsible for the low speed of either download or upload of international content access.

MCMC, so how you gonna help? Your minimum requirement for broadband is 80% of the advertised speed.
