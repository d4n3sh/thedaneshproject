Oracle got into the Linux playing field with it's Oracle Enterprise Linux which is based on Redhat's Enterprise Linux. Oracle then put together the Oracle Unbreakable Linux support program to provide full Linux support to their customers.

Oracle Unbreakable Linux support is not limited to only Oracle products. Customers can switch any of their current Enterprise Linux environments over to the Oracle Unbreakable Linux support program and at a lower cost. If I'm not wrong it's as simple as running a RPM file.

Take it for a spin. Order the Oracle Unbreakable Linux 2-DVD kit for free. Just like [Ubuntu][2], [Netbeans][3] and many other opensource software out there today. [Go to the order page][4].
