ESPN together with New York City ad agency Wieden + Kennedy teamed up to create these hilarious yet clever Posters to honor the World Cup 2010 which is scheduled to start in a few days.

Each of the 32 countries participating in the World Cup are represented by their own poster. My personal favorites are the Australian, Japan and Italy posters.

Really cool ha... [See them all][1]
