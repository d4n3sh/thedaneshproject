Ever wondered what Apple's MacBook Air looks like on the inside? TechRepublic took theirs apart and made a small pictorial of the process. [See the pictures][2].

Without an optical drive Apple managed to bring the overall size down and through the use of hidden connectors for usb and vga they managed keep the lines smooth all around.

The MacBook Air is a beauty but somehow the inside does not impress me. Maybe it's seem a bit too simple or maybe it's just me. I don't know ðŸ™‚
