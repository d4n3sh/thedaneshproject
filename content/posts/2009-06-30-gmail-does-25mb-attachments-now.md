Not sure if you've realized but Gmail has raised it's maximum attachment size from 10MB to 25MB. This is great, I don't have to attach crappy low quality videos anymore.

Some people have commented that the 25MB limit only works with the the manual HTML upload tool and not the flash upload tool as it' limits them to 10MB. I've personally tested this and the 25MB limits works fine on both. Could have been slow roll out of the code or something.
