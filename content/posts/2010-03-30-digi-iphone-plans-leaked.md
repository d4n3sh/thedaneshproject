Guess you already know that DIGI's bringing in the [iPhone][1] now.

No pricing details have been officially released by DIGI so far but somehow yesterday the plans leaked out. I would not be surprised if the leak was intentional, they gotta hype it up right ðŸ˜€

Anyways, here are the plans.

<div id='gallery-5' class='gallery galleryid-2019 gallery-columns-4 gallery-size-thumbnail'>
  <figure class='gallery-item'> 
  
  <div class='gallery-icon landscape'>
    <a href='/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DIGI-iphone.Chart_.jpg)
  </div></figure><figure class='gallery-item'> 
  
  <div class='gallery-icon landscape'>
