<!--more-->

Project _**Pro Kasih**_ was setup to reduce the number of strays suffering on pour streets everyday by neutering existing strays populations and releasing them to live out their natural lives.

Aims of neutering strays:

  1. Reduce number of unwanted animals.
  2. Reduce nuisance caused by strays
  3. Prevent recolonization by other un-neutered strays
  4. Reduce transmission of diseases
  5. Reduce stress of unwanted pregnancies

I love animals, any kind actually but my favourite has to be dogs. Dogs are and always will be man's best friends for their loyalty and love.

I am thinking of participating in the Dogathon this Sunday. Anyone else interested?

I have a question for you. Are we humans really so superior compared to all other leaving beings? Why do so many people abandon their dogs once they get old and big? Will they do the same to their own kids?
