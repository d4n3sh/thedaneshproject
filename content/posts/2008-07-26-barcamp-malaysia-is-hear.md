BarCamp's in a few hours. It's gonna be my first. The Google Android session is what I'm going for first.

What is BarCamp? It's an Unconference .

Interested? Initialy seats were [limited][1] but due to overwhelming interest from the public, BarCamp decided to opened up it's door to all. Just walk in.
