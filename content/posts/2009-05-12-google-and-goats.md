Having grass issues at home? Don't want to throw cash away maintaining your lawn?

Google had the same problem at their Mountain View headquarters. They had fields that needed maintenance and wanted to low carbon solution.

Well, GOATS!! Yup, you heard me, GOATS!!

Google got 200 goats and a border collie to manage them. The goats took 2 weeks to trim the fields while fertilizing at the same time. The goats were taken from [California Grazing][2].

I'm actually thinkin of getting maybe one goat now to mow my lawn. Actually, there might be a market for this here. What ya think?
