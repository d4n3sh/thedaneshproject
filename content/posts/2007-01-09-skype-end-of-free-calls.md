Skype to Skype calls and chats will still remain free as usual.  
If you use Skype regularly to make calls like me then you might consider getting the yearly plan for USD15, that's about RM50 here in Malaysia. You will be entitled to make unlimited calls to the United States and Canada for the whole year. The 15USD price is only valid till 31st Jan 2007, after that the price will double to USD30/year. Grab it quick I say!!
