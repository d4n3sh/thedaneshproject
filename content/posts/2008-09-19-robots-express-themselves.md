Robots with facial expression, being able to convey emotions. Now this is freaking awesome. Imagine their application in the real world.

There's one place I'd love to see them, Malaysian toll booths. So called for the physically challenged but yet everyone reports never meeting a physically challeged person at a toll booth.

O!! the stupidity, a person to dispatch tickets, how dumb do you need to be to take a job like this? Parking lots have automated systems don't they?
