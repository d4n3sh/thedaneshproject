Previously, I covered [xs.my][1] . Today it's [lynx.my][2] ,Â  another Malaysian based URL shortening service. [Check it out][2].

However, unlike xs.my, lynx.my does not generate a random URL string for you. Instead, you have to provide your own shortened string. While this is good, I see it coming back to bite it's users when they discover that their string had already been used. This alone might motivate users to move to other services which automatically generate random URL string.
