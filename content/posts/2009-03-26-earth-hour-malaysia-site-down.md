The Earth Hour Malaysia portal / website [earthhour.org.my][1] is currently unreachable.

Looks like they are moving to a larger hosting provider.Last minute rush to pledge causing the spike I guess.

Follow the progress on their [twitter][2].

Update: The site's back up but it's a stripped down version.
