Dropbox has finally come out of beta and is now available to everyone. With the public launched the company also introduced their open source Linux client which integrates seamlessly with nautilus and with a bit of work, [KDE][2] too. [Get dropbox now][3]. There is also a dedicated client for the iPhone.

I guess with Dropbox and Internet connectivity one could forget about their USB thumb drives now.
