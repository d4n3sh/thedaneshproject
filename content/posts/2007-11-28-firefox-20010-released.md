Firefox 2.0.0.10 has been released. This is a security update which fixes the issues listed below.

> [MFSA 2007-39][1]{.high} Referer-spoofing via window.location race condition  
> [MFSA 2007-38][2]{.high} Memory corruption vulnerabilities (rv:1.8.1.10)  
> [MFSA 2007-37][3]{.high} jar: URI scheme XSS hazard

Firefox will automatically update itself to the latest version but if it does not you can download the latest version from the [Firefox homepage][4]. My Firefox is up2date, is yours?
