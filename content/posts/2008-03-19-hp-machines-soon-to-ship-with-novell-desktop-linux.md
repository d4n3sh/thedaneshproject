HP is planning to roll out a few of it's Notebooks and Desktops preloaded with Novell's Enterprise Desktop 10 (SLED10). Dell had the head start with it's offering of machines preloaded with Ubuntu and recently also preloaded with SLED10.

_Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are really excited because of the power that the HP distribution channel brings, the reach they have and their commitment to interoperability. I am very enthusiastic about what this relationship could bring,Ã¢â‚¬?_ Novell CEO Ron Hovsepian told eWEEK in an interview during Novell's BrainShare 2008 conference.

This is good for Linux, not that Linux is going to overwhelm Microsoft's market share anytime soon but it will certainly help built much needed awareness among users. From the hands of hobbyist into the enterprise environment.
