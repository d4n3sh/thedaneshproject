[Foxmarks][1] is the first extension I install every time I setup Firefox.I never have to worry about loosing my bookmarks anymore and now my passwords too!

Recently it's being acting up with a &#8220;unknown error occurred (411)&#8221;Â  error during setup. The workaround fortunately is quite simple.

1. Go to Tools &#8211;> Foxmarks &#8211;> Foxmarks Settings &#8211;> Advanced  
2. Change encryption to &#8220;Encrypt All&#8221;.

That's it.
