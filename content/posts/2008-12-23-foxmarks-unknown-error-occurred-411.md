[Foxmarks][1] is the first extension I install every time I setup Firefox.I never have to worry about loosing my bookmarks anymore and now my passwords too!

Recently it's being acting up with a "unknown error occurred (411)"Â  error during setup. The workaround fortunately is quite simple.

1. Go to Tools -> Foxmarks -> Foxmarks Settings -> Advanced  
2. Change encryption to "Encrypt All".

That's it.
