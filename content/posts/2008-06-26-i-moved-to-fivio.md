It's done. DNS records are up to date, mysql synchronized and directory structure intact.

My new hosting provider is Fivio Internet Services.

Why?

Simple, I'm tired of the big players. Shared hosting users don't get the respect they need most times and I'm not alone on this. Many share my experience.

It's time to look elsewhere. Smaller upcoming providers like Fivio will always have their customers taken care of well. It's just good business ethics. 

I've had excellent support from them during my move so far and looking forward to a great hosting experience with them.
