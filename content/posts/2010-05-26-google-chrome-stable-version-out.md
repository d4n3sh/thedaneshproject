Google, today released a new stable release of it's popular web browser Google Chrome packed with all the beta goodies we have come to love. To add to the excitement, this will also be the first stable release of the browser for the [Linux][1] and [Mac][2] platforms.

What's in it you ask?

1. HTML 5, Geolocation APIs, App Cache, web sockets, and file drag-and-drop. Make sure to try drag n drop in GMAIL!!

2. Improved sync. Bookmarks, themes,Â preferences, homepage and startup settings, web content settings, preferred languages, and even page zoom settings.

3. Enable individual extensions in incognito mode.

Your Chrome browser should auto update but if you can't wait grab a copy [here][3].
