Delicious now supports bulk edits on your bookmarks! This has been a feature that I have been waiting for a long time now.

You can now share, unshare, tag and untag multiple bookmarks at a time.

The feature's currently in beta but is available to all delicious users. The shortcut's on the top right corner.
