This is something all transformers fans should have.

The 2GB USB flash drive transforms from a regular looking flash drive into Ravage.  However, in  it's transformed state, Ravage's USB port is not longer accessible. Who cares right? As long as it looks cool!

It's not cheap, USD 42.99 for a thumb drive. You'd have to be a die hard fan to drop that kind of cash for a 2GB USB drive. Also, for an extra 2 bucks you could get the collector's edition. It's hand chosen, guaranteed to be in mint condition and meant to got on display in it's packaging.

Besides price, it's still an awesome looking flash drive.
