I was researching on the net last night and stumbled upon this post at DoshDosh. It talks about how to best utilize the various sponsored blogging services available today. 17 in total. The services covered are [PayPerPost][1], [ReviewMe][2] ,[SponsoredReview][3] and 15 others.

My blog is still new and so am I to the whole blogging scene. I have to work hard for some time before I consider start looking at advertising on my blog.

For now I&#8217;m thinking of looking at sponsered posts. I think it will help me discipline myself in the blogging space by forcing me to blog frequently and with quality.

Are you into sponsored post? Tell me bout them&#8230;
