Sorry guys,

I won&#8217;t be posting anything new today.

First, freaking Streamyx has been screwed for the past 2 days. I call them up and all I got was the damn machine. &#8221; Users might experience slow access to international sites&#8221;, &#8220;regular maintenance work is being carried out from 12am till 6am for 4 day&#8221;. SIGH&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..

Second, I was playing around with Compiz Fusion on my NB and desktop and some how managed to screw them both up. Guess this is what happens when you try too many things and can&#8217;t remember what you changed.

See you tomorrow.
