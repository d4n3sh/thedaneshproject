I was fortunate enough to get invited into Netizens, the latest advertising network to hit our shores.

Other blogs who made the first batch wereÃ‚Â  [hongkiat.com][2], [LiewCF.com][3], [LingzieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tummy Treat][4], [Malaysian Politics][5], [Chinese Music Blog][6], [FriedbeefÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tech][7], [Rasa Malaysia][8], Get Found and My 1st Path .

Netizens prides itself for being different from the other advertising networks currently available in Malaysia. It's set out to put more dollars back into the publishers hands then then conventional CPM concepts that we have all come to know very well. Not that the CPM models don't work but Netizens insists that publishers should be given a large piece of the cake for their efforts.

My advertising slots are currently priced from RM80/month and above.

Read about how Netizens was born and meet the team here.

Netizens is currently in Beta stage and has planned it's soft launch for 1st March 2008.
