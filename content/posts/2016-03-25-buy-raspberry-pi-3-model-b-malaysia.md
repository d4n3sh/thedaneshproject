TMT.my is a subsidiary of the popular IT chain storeThunder Match Technology Sdn. Bhd. They don't have the Raspberry Pi 3 listed on their site yet but it might be worth [calling][6] them up as they have been known to have stock in the stores for walk-in customers.

### Official Raspberry Pi Distributors

![element14 Sdn. Bhd](https://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-12109-157644/313-48/element14+LOGO.png 'element14 Sdn. Bhd') - RM170

RS and Element 14 are both official distributors for the Raspberry Pi globally. Getting the Raspberry Pi from either one will be the cheapest option especially if you're planning to buy in bulk.

Ok, that's it for now. Hope this post helps you get started on your Raspberry Pi 3 adventure.
