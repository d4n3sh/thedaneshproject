Look at the lady in the picture below. Is she spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise?

![][1] 

We use both sides of our brains to understand what we see, feel and smell. In this example your brain will either tell you that she is spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise. If you use your right brain then she would spin clockwise and if you use your left brain you'll see her spin anti-clockwise, this is what most people see but I saw her spin clockwise initially.

Can you change the direction she spins? The answer is yes. Concentrate and you might pull it off, I did ðŸ™‚

So what does this all mean? [Read on][2] to find out but not till you have done the above.
