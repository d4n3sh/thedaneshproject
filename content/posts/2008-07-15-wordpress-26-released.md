WordPress 2. 6 (Tyner) is out with some new improvements.

1. Post Revisions :: You get to diff your post changes now.

2. A new Press This! button. :: Directly post from any site you are on. Plus support to automatically detect media files from sites like YouTube and Flickr.

2. Google Gears :: My fav, you get a local cache for your WordPress. Speedier access and the possibility of new and better feature moving forward.

3. Theme Previews :: Now you get to preview your theme without enabling it.

  * You can now have many thousands of pages or categories with no interface issues.
  * Ability to move your `wp-config` file and `wp-content` directories to a custom location, for Ã¢â‚¬Å“cleanÃ¢â‚¬? SVN checkouts.
  * Select a range of checkboxes with Ã¢â‚¬Å“shift-click.Ã¢â‚¬?
  * You can toggle between the Flash uploader and the classic one.
