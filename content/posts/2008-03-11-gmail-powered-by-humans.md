Awesome work by a team of guys to reproduce the Gmail interface in a studio. They actually managedÃ‚Â  simulate clicks, tag searches and even the mobile version of Gmail. The details are outstanding and quite realistic. Love the dual purpose hand held mouse pointer they came up with.  
Watch it for yourself and tell me what you think.
