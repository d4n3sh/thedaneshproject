Raja, my buddy for the past 6 years is now part of The Danesh Project. We started off working in the same company for about 4 years and now have moved on to different places but our passion or Linux,open-source and beer keeps the friendship going.

Raja is new to the the blogging arena so I thought this would be a good place for him to get started. He will primarily be posting about Linux, open-source, IT news and occasionally some local news from Malaysia.

Raja's first post : [Fedora 8 Officially Released][1]
