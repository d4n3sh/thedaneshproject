Shinjiru will be moving my shared hosting account to a new server tomorrow. The move is scheduled for 9pm (GMT +8) 8th May 2008.

Since my DNS records will also need to be updated, The Danesh Project will be down till the updated DNS entries propagate to all DNS servers on the net. This will take up to 72 hours.
