[<img src="http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/images/2007/01/30/image2411881g.jpg" align="left" />][1]CBS posted a cool article regarding tattoos in the workplace yesterday.

Research found that 23% of college students have 1-3 tats,51% are pierced beyond the woman's ears and 36% of 18-29 year olds have tats today. WOW!!

My favourite quote from the article read &#8220;Because you don't like it or it offends you or you're conservative in the workplace, I think you'll miss a whole talent pool of people who are very bright well educated, smart and free thinking.It's a shame. You never want to do that. You have to evolve.&#8221;

&#8220;It has to change, otherwise they're going to be out of a workforce,&#8221;
