Good news toÃ‚Â  Malaysian Ubuntu users. [Inigo-Tech][1] has setup a local Ubuntu repository mirror.Ã‚Â  &#8221; http://mirror.inigo-tech/ubuntu &#8221;

To use the repository simply add it suing the Synaptic Package Manager or you could edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file to include the line below,

> &#8220; `deb http://mirror.inigo-tech.com/ubuntu/ feisty feisty-backports universe multiverse "`

I can't test the performance gain as I don't have an ubuntu box at home but I am quite sure you would see improvements since we don't need to access the super fast (ya right!!) international gateway.

Please drop me a note on your experience with this new mirror.

[Inigo-Tech][1] also has a mirror for FreeBSD setup. Read more here.
