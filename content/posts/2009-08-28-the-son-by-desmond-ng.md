Most of us hate, why hate we don&#8217;t know. Maybe it&#8217;s the way we were brought up? Maybe it&#8217;s our segregated education system? Maybe it&#8217;s our politicians and their political agendas? Maybe it&#8217;s the crowd we join? I don&#8217;t know, you tell me.

This 15MALAYSIA short film by [Desmond Ng][1] gives you a glimpse into the topic.

A teenage Chinese witness to a racially motivated assault is being driven to the police station. A quiet reminder of the dangers of inter-communal suspicion and conflict.

Watch [the making][2].
