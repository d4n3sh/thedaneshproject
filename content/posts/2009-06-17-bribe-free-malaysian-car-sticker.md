Need a new bumber sticker? BFM has a cool one out which says &#8220;BRIBE-FREE MALAYSIAN&#8221;.

[BFM][2]&#8216;s giving them away for free. Drop them a request [here][3] and you'll get your sticker by mail in a few days.

It's gonna be interesting to see how many [hypocrites][4] will have this sticker on their cars. Being Malaysian means learning to BRIBE right? sigh&#8230;&#8230;
