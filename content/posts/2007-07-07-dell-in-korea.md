The new inspiron notebooks look quite slick with the colored skins and the girls showing them off look equally hot. The pictures are from the Inspiron product launch held in Korea recently.

Retailing at RM1999 for the entry level specs and going up to RM5000++ for the higher performance specs, the inspiron caters to all user level. Be it the gamer who needs a portable gaming solution or the urban housewife who spends time emailing,blogging and looking for new recipes online.

I am happy with my Dell notebooks. I have a Latitude D610 running Vista and another Latitude D620 running openSUSE10.2.Â  They have served me well till now and I hope they continue to stay that way.
