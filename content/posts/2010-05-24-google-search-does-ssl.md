With online privacy being the main concern for mostÂ internetÂ users today, Google has responded to them by introducing SSL support to its search.

Google SSL Search willÂ encryptÂ all your search traffic preventing any third party eyes from lookingÂ at it.Â BrowsingÂ overÂ https will also disable "referrer" which site owners normally use to see where you'reÂ comingÂ from.

With + there is always - so do remember that browsing in SSL does have an encryption overhead which will slightly degrade the searchÂ performance.

Also, the amount of data collected from your search is the same as the standard search but just more secure.Â WithoutÂ this data Google will be nothing ğŸ™‚

When you are on the new SSL search page you willÂ realizeÂ that the GoogleÂ logo looks different. It will have "ssl" and "beta" in it. Also, maps and images will not show up as they don't support SSL yet.

Simple goto https://google.com to start searching in privacy.
