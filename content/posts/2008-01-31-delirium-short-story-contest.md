[Abinesh][2] is relatively new to the blogging scene but his style of blogging and consistence is something I admire.

_**Delirium**_ is like coffee for me, a cup a day is not enough. _**Delirium**_ is truly Abinesh's take on the world.

_**Danny**_ loves coffee

Remember Delirium's second contest [Win a HP Kensington Wireless mouse][3]?. The contest ends tomorrow so get your short stories in now before it's too late if you want a go at the HP mouse.
