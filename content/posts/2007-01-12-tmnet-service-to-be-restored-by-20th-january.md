TM Net announced that it's international link will be fully restored by the 20th of January. Currently 50% of the capacity has been restored and traffic going to the US will be restored to 80% by the 12th of January.

**My View:** Somehow I'm not convinced by the announcement. To start I've never experience good internet in Malaysia ever. I give them another month or more before everything is back to norm.
