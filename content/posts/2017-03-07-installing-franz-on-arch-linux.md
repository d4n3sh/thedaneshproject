[Franz][1] is a new multi-platform messaging app for Linux, MAC and Windows. Been running it my Arch boxes for a few months now and am loving it!

It's not in the default repo so you'll need the AUR to install it. [ArchWiki][2]

Once you have your AUR setup, pull the package down and build it.

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">~>$ yaourt -Sy franz-bin
```
