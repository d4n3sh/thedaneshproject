Happy 50th birthday Malaysia. I'm late to wish you but better late then never right.

You have been good to me but even though everything is not perfect I won't complain now. We have so much more then what many others out there have. It's time for us us to wake up and start doing the smaller things in live that matter the most. Help those in need, give them education, give them hope, give them a future as if they were your own family.

Never looking at the colour of your skin, your language, your religion, your race or what your do for a leaving. That's a true Malaysian.

Happy 50th Birthday Malaysia!!
