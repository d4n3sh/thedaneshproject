XS.my , Malaysia's very own tinyurl service. The service is provided by [Netizens Media][1].

Put in a long URL and out comes a shorten XS.my URL.

I'm hoping that Netizens Media will publish some stats on the service. Would be interesting to see how many Malaysian's actually use Malaysian services like this.
