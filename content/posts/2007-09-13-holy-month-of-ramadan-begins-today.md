Muslims around the world begin fasting today as it marks the beginning of the Holy month of Ramadan. Fasting is not easy task, it takes motivation, determination, faith and willpower. I have never fasted for more then a day. Maybe I'll try it with my Muslim pals this time.

Ramadan will end with the festival of "Eid al-Fitr" or "Hari Raya Aidilfitri" as we know it here. New clothes, big feasts, cookies galore and my favourite, visiting my Muslim friends.

To all my Muslim friends in Malaysia, "SELAMAT BERPUASA". To my Muslim friends around the world "HAPPY FASTING"
