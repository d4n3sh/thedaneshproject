WordPress 2.8.2 is out. It fixes an important XSS vulnerability. Make sure to upgrade quick before you get hijacked&#8230;.

Either perform an auto update by going to &#8221; tools &#8211;> upgrade &#8211;> upgrade automatically &#8221; or upgrade the old fashion ways by [downloading WordPress][2].
