I have been commuting to Cyber Jaya for the past 3 weeks and yesterday I heard some disturbing news about a new syndicate operating along the [MRR2][1] highway. People call them the &#8220;_**Crash Masters**_&#8220;.

The &#8220;_**Crash Masters**_&#8221; drive recklessly along the highway and get you to crash into their vehicle from the back by applying emergency breaks. They are not after your cash or your vehicle, what they want is your insurance claims and towing business. Don't be surprised if the tow truck gets there within 5 minutes. Most times you will find the tow guy immediately recommending you which mechanic to go to for your claims and also get your vehicle prep up for towing without even getting approval from you beforehand.

I am not sure if this really happens as I've not experienced it and don't intend to but would want to advice everyone to be careful anyway. Make sure to keep a good distance between you and the car in front of you at all time to give you sufficient room to break when needed.
