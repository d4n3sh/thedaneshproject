[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/streamyx_40mbps_promo.thumbnail.png" title="streamyx_40mbps_promo.png" alt="streamyx_40mbps_promo.png" align="left" />][1]Saw the ad in the papers this morning. Streamyx at 4.0 mbps, hard to believe but yes it's true.

The current promotion package is priced at RM198 /month, RM70 cheaper then the normal price 268/month. Promotion ends till June 17, 2007.

I'm thinkin hard if I sould jump on the deal or wait for feedback from others before I decide. Anyone out there interested or already running the new 4.0mbps package? I need your advice.
