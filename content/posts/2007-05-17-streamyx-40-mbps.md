The current promotion package is priced at RM198 /month, RM70 cheaper then the normal price 268/month. Promotion ends till June 17, 2007.

I'm thinkin hard if I sould jump on the deal or wait for feedback from others before I decide. Anyone out there interested or already running the new 4.0mbps package? I need your advice.
