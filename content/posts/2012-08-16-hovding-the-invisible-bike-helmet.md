No one likes bicycle helmets, they&#8217;re heavy, bulky and simply look weird. However, they keep us alive and I&#8217;d rather stay alive with an ugly helmet on then die without one.

The overall design of a helmet has not changed for a long time and it always seemed impossible to come up with a better design until now that is.

Design students  Anna and Terese thought it was possible. 7 years of hard work later they came up with the invisible helmet &#8220;HÖVDING&#8221;.

It&#8217;s essentially an air bag designed into a collar that fits around your neck with a custom shell designs to match your outfit. It will inflate in 0.1 sec when abnormal movement is detected either from a collision and when the rider falls of his bike. [Read more][1]

You can buy a &#8220;HÖVDING&#8221; for 3998 SEK (USD 600) from their [online store.][2]  I love the design, I&#8217;d buy it now if I had the money , guess I&#8217;ll have to wait.

Watch the video and be wowed.<!--more-->
