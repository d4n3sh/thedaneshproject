If you have spare time or feel stressed as I do mostly all the time nowadays then this the game you should be playing. The idea of the game is to build towers in strategic areas on the map and prevent the creeps from moving forward. Involves quite good amount of thinking and strategy. Trust me once you start they ain't no turning back!!
