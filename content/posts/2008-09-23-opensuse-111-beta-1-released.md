openSUSE 11.1 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.

Some of the important changes;

Linux kernel 2.6.27rc5.

GNOME 2.24 and KDE 4.1.x will be the default desktop choices. KDE 3.5.10 will still available under the &#8220;other window managers&#8221; section. I&#8217;m not a big fan of KDE 4 yet but for testing I&#8217;ll take it for a spin.

Amarok 2.0 Beta 1 for KDE 4 and Banshee 3.1 for GNOME. Amarok 2 is gonna rock!!

IPv6 support. Run in an IPv6 environment and run IPv6 based web servers.

Support for SELinux alongside the Novell&#8217;s AppArmor.
