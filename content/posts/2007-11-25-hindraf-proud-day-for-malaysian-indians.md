  Today was a proud day to be an Indian in Malaysia! We have awakened from a long sleep! Wanna know why?
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  Let me tell you my story, as one individual that formed one of the hundred thousands that were gathered around the British embassy in several areas despite the tear gas, water canons containing chemicals and police road blocks.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  My dad and me decided to take the LRT to Ampang Park LRT Station which is the closest to the embassy. Reason being many of the main roads were closed. However, we met our first obstacle. The train did not stop at the KLCC station and neither did it stop at the Ampang Park station. A true Malaysian, a Muslim, told us that both stations were closed and that the train will only stop at Kg. Baru, a station before the KLCC station and Damai station, a station after Ampang Park. He even told us the way to get to the gathering and this is without we requesting any information from him. This is a person who understood the reason for the gathering. It was not a gathering purely for the rights of Indians but Malaysians as a whole.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  So, we got down at the Damai station and started walking towards KLCC. A large group of people were following at the back of us. Very proud to have such support, we started walking even faster. Suddenly, we saw a group of people walking from the opposite direction. One young man stopped to inform us that tear gas is being shot by the police. He asked us to turn back because the effects of the tear gas was so bad that we would not be able to take it. We told him thank you for the information and that we have come so far, we are not going to turn back just because tear gas is being shot. We continued to walk towards KLCC. The large group behind us was also marching with us. We finally reached the Jalan Semarak junction.

  We heard screams from people. We were shocked to see the amount of FRU trucks parked there and FRU personnel on a frenzy of shooting tear gas towards the crowd. They were shooting everywhere. One of the cannisters actually hit a guy and left his back swollen. He did not give up. He washed his back and continued to walk to find another location to gather. He was not ready to go back till the purpose he was there is reached.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  My eyes and skin were burning as if hot water was splashed on my face. My nose and trachea was also burning. Once again, the true Malaysian spirit was seen. A Muslim family from Kg. Baru actually gave us water and helped us to wash off. I had tears in my eyes to see this show of support. We were always being led by the false impression that the Malays are not happy with the Indians and the Chinese. However the truth is, the Rakyat have no problem with each other. It is the politicians that create their own stories and cause racial problems. Let be UMNO, MIC or MCA. Our government failed to see that we are not Malays, Indians or Chinese. We are Malaysians. Why can&#8217;t the government accept this fact?
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  Anyway, back to my story. Once the effect of the tear gas wore out, we continued our journey to the embassy. We were not deterred. It took around 45 minutes to walk up to Renaissance Hotel. We had to stop there. We could not walk any further as there were police blocks. In the road in front of the hotel we saw a large gathering. We joined the group. We kept walking further in in the midst of the crowd. Then we heard people cheering. We saw our young leaders standing proud and giving their speech. There was Uthaya Kumar, Manoharan, Surendran, Tien Chua, Razak and other leaders. They gave speeches that would ignite the spirit of every Malaysian.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  No one spoke purely about Indians although there were the Indian sentiments mentioned. We were asked to ensure that we register ourselves as voters tomorrow and show the need for change through democracy. We told to be peaceful no matter what happens and was warned against the use of force to achieve our goals. They told the crowds to not get carried away with other issues and were very focused on only one matter, we want our voice to be heard and our rights granted to us and lastly, to be respected as a Malaysian. No more accusing that every crime is committed by an Indian, no more deaths in prison which are usually Indians. They were pure truthful leaders who had no hidden agendas. They did not represent the political parties but merely individuals who are fighting for the people&#8217;s rights. Once the speech was over, we were told to disperse peacefully. The crowd quietly dispersed off. There was no property damage or outburst of feelings. It was so peaceful. It felt like I was in school once again on my way back to the classroom after the usual Monday morning school assemblies. It really felt good.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  The message that was passed to the Malaysian government and the Malaysian Indian Congress, the so-called representatives of Malaysian Indians is that we are no longer going to tolerate and allow ourselves to be bullied. If we are not given our rights, we are going to fight for it. We are not going to keep quiet and allow the so-called representatives to speak for us. Enough is enough!!!! 30 years of suffering and no more to add on. I want my child to say proudly that he/ she is a Malaysian. I don&#8217;t want my child to go through what I had to. It is so heart breaking to say that I am an Indian even though I was born in Malaysia and my parents are Malaysian.
