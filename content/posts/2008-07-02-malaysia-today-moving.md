The controvertial news portal in Malaysia, Malaysia Today by Raja Petra is moving.

The old site was http://www.malaysia-today.net/ and the new site is http://www.malaysia-today.net/blogs. But somehow the URL seems to be down. I am not sure if http://www.malaysiatoday.com is the new site. Anyone?

Update: 27-08-2008 [Malaysia Today blocked by TMNET][2]
