P1 has a new marketing strategy out. Instead of planning where to "P1 W1MAX" enable, they are asking their users to vote for the next "P1 W1MAX" coverage areas. the current top 10;

1. Petaling Jaya, SS2  
2. Kajang, Bandar Sungai Long  
3. Kuala Lumpur, Jalan Ipoh  
4. Petaling Jaya, Seksyen 14  
5. Seri Kembangan, Taman Universiti Indah  
6. Puchong, Taman Puchong Permai  
7. Kepong, Desa Aman Puri  
8. Petaling Jaya, Taman Bahagia  
9. Johor Bahru, Taman Istimewa  
10. Alor Setar, Pumpong

Well, I guess it's a good idea but what happens to the poor souls living in lover density areas? Will they have to wait till all hot spots have been satisfied before being serviced? I hope not, P1 should identify key areas and continue their deployment as planed but keep the voting options open as a bonus feature. The voted areas should be serviced but not at the expense of the underpopulated areas.

If P1 is to kill StreamyX, one thing's gonna be of utmost importance, that is to listen to your customers and keep them happy. StreamyX does a F**KED UP job at keeping it's users happy and not to forget, they have the worst engineers ever!! I have been waiting for almost 2 months for an engineer to check my line!!

I need P1 W1MAX !! [Vote for my area][2], "Taman Maluri, Cheras".

TQ, TQ, ðŸ˜€
