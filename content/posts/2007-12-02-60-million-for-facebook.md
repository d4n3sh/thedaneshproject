Asia's richest man, MrLi Ka Shing has invested $60Million in Facebook, the current favourite soscial networking around the world.Ã‚Â  Microsoft also did show interest by investing $240Million in the estimated $15Billion comapany not too long ago.

My current fav is Facebook but yes sometimes it does get overwhelming with the 100's of applications being passed around. But the idea behind it and how quick it's being adapted by end users around the world is what's molding Facebook into a investor's prime target.
