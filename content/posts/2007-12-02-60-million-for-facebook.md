Asia&#8217;s richest man, MrLi Ka Shing has invested $60Million in Facebook, the current favourite soscial networking around the world.Ã‚Â  Microsoft also did show interest by investing $240Million in the estimated $15Billion comapany not too long ago.

My current fav is Facebook but yes sometimes it does get overwhelming with the 100&#8217;s of applications being passed around. But the idea behind it and how quick it&#8217;s being adapted by end users around the world is what&#8217;s molding Facebook into a investor&#8217;s prime target.
