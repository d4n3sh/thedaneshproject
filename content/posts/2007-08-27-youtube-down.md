Can you access [YouTube][1]? I can't. All I get is _**"Http/1.1 Service Unavailable"**_

<strike>[Mashable][4] had an update stating that YouTube was down but came back after a 6 hour outage but somehow I still can't get throug.</strike>

Sorry guys, Mashable's post was from 2006. My bad, totally missed that. Thanks David.

Update (21:11 GMT +8) : YouTube is back up.

Update (22:18 GMT +8) : You Tube is down again. It was up like 20 minutes ago.

Anyone else facing this?
