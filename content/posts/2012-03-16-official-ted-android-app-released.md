[TED][2] has finally released its official Android app. You can now watch all your favorite TEDtalks on your Android phones and tablets.

2 main features to love. First, Offline browsing, useful when I'm on a plane or out of coverage. Second, Audio only, handy while driving to work.

Other common features include latest videos, search, sharing and bookmarks.

Go grab it on [Google Play][3]
