PDFreaders.org is the latest project from "The [Fellowship][1] of the [Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)][2]".

PDF have become a standard when it comes to distributing documents today. From eBooks to magazines and brochures, nothing is spared from going PDF.

The fellowship is out to promote open standards for the PDF format. Open standard allows everyone to access PDF files on any device or OS and not be held back by the propitiatory mambo jumbo.

The project currently publishes a list for free PDF readers which are open standard. The list will also cover writers in the future so make sure to check back often.

Also, remember to spread to love with the PDFreaders.org buttons.
