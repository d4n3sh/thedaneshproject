What would you do?

That is the question I keep asking myself now.

I have a good stable job in a large company but the salary is average. I was offered to go back to my previous company who is willing to pay me 100% more then what I am earning now.

My problem is I love what I do now and the career path it promises in the long run but I need more cash to fix my personal life and to save for my future use. I have always worked to gain experiance and not the salary but I feel now I need to start looking at the dollars instead. In my current position it will take me 3 years to work my way up to the salary currently being offered to me.

What would you do?
