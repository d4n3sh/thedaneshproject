[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-840" title="Upgrade to Firefox 3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/fx3-major-update-available-500x447.png" alt="" width="500" height="447" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/fx3-major-update-available-500x447.png 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/08/fx3-major-update-available.png 733w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />][1]

Users on the latest Firefox 2, version 2.0.0.17 should start receiving software updates later today prompting them to upgrade to Firefox 3.

The update is automated so no user intervention is needed expect for clicking yes on the license agreement disclaimer page.

Most extensions are already Firefox 3 capable so chances of you running an outdated extension is quite slim. The compatibility checker will notify you of such cases and offer the option to have them updated.

If you can&#8217;t wait then simply go to &#8220;Help&#8221; &#8211;> &#8220;Check for updates&#8221; to start the process manually.
