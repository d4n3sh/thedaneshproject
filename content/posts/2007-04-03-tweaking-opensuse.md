2 resources you must have to enjoy the full experience of an openSUSE Desktop.

1. [openSUSE Community][1]

If you enjoy doing everything manually as I do then you will certainly find everything you need here.

- Adding and managing openSUSE package sources.  
- Adding and managing third party package sources.  
- Enable support for restricted formats. (mp3,dvd,etc&#8230;.)  
- Good FAQ section.

2. [konvenientSUSE][2] 

Automates the process of tweaking your openSUSE installation. Basicly does everything above through GUI.

- Adds package repositories / installation sources.  
- Installs multimedia codecs.  
- Enable Encrypted DVD (DVD movies) playback support.  
- Enable support for Java and Flash.  
- Install Nvidia and ATi 3D drivers.  
- Ditch ZENWorks.
