iPhone 3G is coming to Singapore.

22nd August's the date. 12:01am's the time. So make sure you're [there][2] ( [Singtel stores][3] )to pick yours up.

[Singtel][4] will be carrying the phone. The price [plans][5] have also been published. For lower plans you'll have to pay for the phone but for those on premium plans the iPhone 3G will be free.

Was thinking of getting myself an iPhone 3G but the plan has since changed with HTC's plans to release HTC Dream ( powered by Android ) in the coming months.
