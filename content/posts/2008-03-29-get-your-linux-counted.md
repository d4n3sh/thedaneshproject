Just how many Linux are out there today? No one knows for sure but it's pretty obvious that the number keeps increasing as the Linux is gaining audience from all over.

The Linux Counter Project was stated back in 1999. The project'a goal was and still is to count how many Linux users and Linux based machines are out there.

I've got my self counted and received my badge seen below.

If you are a Linux user then make sure to register yourself and your Linux machines. It's simple,

1. Goto The Linux Counter and click "Get Counted".

2. Fill up the form and you'll receive your badge. Check your mail too.

3. Check your mail or go here to register your Linux machines. There's a simple script which you can [download][3] and run from your Linux machine to register it.

Let's start counting&#8230;.
