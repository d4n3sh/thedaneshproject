It's time to change my blog's theme. As usual, I'm thorn between 2 themes for my blog.

I need your help. Please help me decide on a theme. Theme A or Theme B.

So far, I seem to be favoring theme A a bit more but ya, I want to see what you have to say too.

Which ever theme wins by popular vote, I will change to end of this week.

## THEME A | [Evidens][1]

## THEME B | [Alligned][2]
