It's RUMORED that the new fuel price in Malaysia effective midnight today will be raised from RM1.92 to RM2.70. That's a 78 cents hike which adds up to about 40%. My Wira gonna cost me about RM110 for a full tank. 

Looks like the petrol pumps around town are gonna be filled up today. 

You endorse the hike? I do, time to think green I would say.
