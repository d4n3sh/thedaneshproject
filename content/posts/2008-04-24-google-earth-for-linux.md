A spanking new release of Google Earth is out. The latest 4.3 release comes with Photo Realistic 3D modeling for buildings, &#8220;Swoop navigation&#8221; for an improved navigation experience, &#8220;Light and shadow&#8221; to catch sunrise and sunset from anywhere and finally the popular &#8220;Street View&#8221; which was previously a Google Maps only feature.

Now something to excite Linux users, Google Earth is now available for Linux. Not on WINE as but as a native application based on Qt and openGL. I'm yet to try it but for those who have I have heard nothing but good reviews with some minor glitches.

However Google Earth for Linux currently only supports the i386 architecture and seems to only work with 32bit processors.

The embedded video speaks for itself.
