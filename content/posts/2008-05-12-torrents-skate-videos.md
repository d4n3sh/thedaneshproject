I torrent quite abit and I know you do too. Thought it would be cool to share some of the torrents I find interesting with you.

Back in school I was part of a skate crew, this was back in Cameron Highlands. Best time of my life.

If I remember right, I went through 5 decks. Powell, Mapel, Shortys and World Industries, Blind tires, Panther bearings andÃ‚Â  not to forget, my DC, ES, Emerica and Globe shoes.

Good old days, it's been a couple of years and I've put on a few pounds. I was fit, light, fast and full of energy. Wish I could turn back time, haa haa&#8230;.

Anyways, here's 2 skate videos I found interesting. [Antiz the Z Movie][3] andÃ‚Â  [411VM Skateboarding Volume15 Issue1][4].

Hope you enjoy them.
