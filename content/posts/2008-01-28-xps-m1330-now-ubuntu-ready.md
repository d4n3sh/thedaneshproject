Dell&#8217;s top of the range notebook and currently also the best notebook from Dell, the XPS M1330 is now being shipped pre-installed with Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). The Ubuntu powered XPS notebooks are currently only available in Germany, UK, France and Spain. Hopefully Dell expands it&#8217;s Ubuntu on Dell range to Malaysia soon. The use of Linux in Asia is constantly growing and one might find this an ideal business opportunity. Don&#8217;t you think so Dell?

Linux on Dell has been a big hit among it&#8217;s customer and potential customers as seen on Direct2Dell. The biggest requests on Dell&#8217;s community sites [direct2dell][2] and [IdeaStorm][3] have been to get [Ubuntu on more hardware][4] and [made available around the globe][5].
