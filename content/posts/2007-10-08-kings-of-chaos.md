Into online text based roll playing games? If your answer is yes then it will certainly be worth your time checking out [Kings Of Chaos][2].

> _In Kings of Chaos, you are in command of an army of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, or undead. To be successful, you must manage your army and defeat your enemies. You must keep your troops in top condition and recover from losses. A powerful army will be strong in all four aspects of the game: attacking, defending, spying, and counter-intelligence. This makes it important to keep your forces and efforts relatively balanced in all these areas. There are a number of ways to build your army and thus generate more gold and become more powerful: you can get people to click on your Unique Link, giving you an additional soldier each time it is clicked. In this age, you can click links up to 5 times per 24 hours. You can also recruit other people as your officers &#8211; for every two soldiers your officers gain from their links, you will gain an extra soldier. You may also buy mercenaries &#8211; soldiers that will fight for you but will not generate extra gold._

KOC started out as a simple experiment with PHP and MySQL by 4 high school juniors. It was a hit on campus and eventually out grew the high school servers it was hosted on with over 15,000 page views a day. KOC moved onto it's own server and domain was really to take on the world.

Me, [Alan][3], [Abi][4] and few others started playing KOC about 2 years back. It spread like wild fire through the office. Everyone and anyone was on KOC. Strategizing, building alliances, planning take overs, recruiting members, clicking to get more soldiers. Man, I miss those days.

Sounnd good? [Get started here][2].
