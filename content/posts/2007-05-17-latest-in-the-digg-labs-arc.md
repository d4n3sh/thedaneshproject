[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/arc.png" title="arc.png" alt="arc.png" align="right" />][1]Arc is the latest animation app in the digg labs that show life digging activity at the topic and sub-topic level represented by rings. The middle ring is sub-topics, inner ring main topic and outer ring represent the most recent dugg topics. The most recent dugg stories will be added to the out ring with a quick flash effect.

Arc gets it's name from lines that link related stories in the outer ring across topics. Stories are linked when an user diggs 2 or more different stories. This makes for a more effective way to discover new topics and stories.

To finish off, Arc has a full screen view that makes use of your whole screen. Nice feature. Now you can see how information grows. Literally.

_<u><strong>My View</strong></u>_

I like the idea behind the tool very much. It's a new way to present and discover information.
