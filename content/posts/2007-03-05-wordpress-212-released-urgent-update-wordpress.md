WordPress 2.1.2 has been released.

There was a security breach on the download servers at [wordpress.org][1] and some files were compromised. If you upgraded to version 2.1.1 in the recent days then the patch is a must for you.

I had my WordPress upgraded about 2 weeks which put me in the safe zone but I upgraded anyway as there were a few additional fixes included with the latest release.

Get the latest version at: [WordPress.org][2]
