Can you go a day without your computers? That's the question the guys at "_Shutdown Day_" are asking. If you think you're up for the challenge then head on over to "_Shutdown Day_" to participate in the experiment.

Just imagine, the whole world goes a day without computers. What happens? Does civilization start over? Could it be the modern day Armageddon?

I am not sure if I could go a day without my machines. I have 4 machines that run 24/7 and depend on each other. My daily life evolves around them. It's going to be hard but I'll try I guess. Let's wait for D-Day and see what happens.
