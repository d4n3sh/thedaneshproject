Can you go a day without your computers? That&#8217;s the question the guys at &#8220;_Shutdown Day_&#8221; are asking. If you think you&#8217;re up for the challenge then head on over to &#8220;_Shutdown Day_&#8221; to participate in the experiment.

Just imagine, the whole world goes a day without computers. What happens? Does civilization start over? Could it be the modern day Armageddon?

I am not sure if I could go a day without my machines. I have 4 machines that run 24/7 and depend on each other. My daily life evolves around them. It&#8217;s going to be hard but I&#8217;ll try I guess. Let&#8217;s wait for D-Day and see what happens.
