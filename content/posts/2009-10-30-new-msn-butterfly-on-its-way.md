It seems that there's a new MSN butterfly on it's way. This could only mean that Microsoft's MSN could be getting a face lift or a touch-up soon.

The new butterfly's super simple and has a strong web 2.0 feel to it. So far I've aware of only 2 variations of the butterfly. Monochrome and color.

I actually feel that the logo's not bad looking, it might be simple but only time with tell if the butterfly flies or crashes.
