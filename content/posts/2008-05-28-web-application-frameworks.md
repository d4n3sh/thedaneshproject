Do you develop using [web application frameworks][1]?

I like the idea of using frameworks to develop. I've played around with Ruby On Rails, Symphony, Django and a few others. They generally help simplify code.

For example, I don't waste time on my db connection , presentation layer, form validation codes anymore and I get to spend more time on the functionality of my applications instead.

Frameworks also help cut down your development time. Handy when slapped with ridiculas project time lines. Go through the [Ruby On Rails demos][2] and you'll see.

Here's a list of [web application frameworks][3] widely used today and their [features comparison][4].
