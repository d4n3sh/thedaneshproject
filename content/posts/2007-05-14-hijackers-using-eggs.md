Got this in my mail today&#8230; read on,

_<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #003366">Hi Everyone,</p> 

I want to bring a very serious issueÂ to your attention:Â </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif""> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #003366">

The hijackers throw eggs at your vehicle, hoping that you then slow down andÂ turn your wipers on. Once youÂ turn your wipers on,  
you cannot see anything. This is just what the hi-jackers want. They stand a few meters away, and once you have pulled over,  
they attack and take your car. Maybe even your life.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif""> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #003366">

In the event of this happening to you, just keep going. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: navy">You're advised to o</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #003366"> pen your window slightly, put your head out the window</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif""> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif"; color: #003366">  
for vision and just keep driving, until you are safe.</span></em>

Do you thing this really happens? I bet your wind screen gonna smell like rotten eggs.
