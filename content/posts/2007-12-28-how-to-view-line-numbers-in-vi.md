When editing large files in vi or vim line numbers become very important.

This is how you turn on/off line numbers in vi or vim.

_**Turn on line numbers**_

While vi is in edit mode and not inserting type the following

> :set number

_ **Turn off line numbers**_

While vi is in edit mode and not inserting type the following

> :set nonumber
