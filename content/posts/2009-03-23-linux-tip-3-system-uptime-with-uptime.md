Want to know how long your Linux box has been up for?

Simple, just run the "uptime" command and you will be rewarded with the answer plus a bit more.

`8:58pm  up  19:54,  1 user,  load average: 0.47, 0.62, 0.35`

Above is the typical reply from uptime. On the left is the current time, followed by the system's uptime, logged in users and finally the system's load average.

Sample output;

`danesh@pandora:~> uptime<br />
8:58pm  up  19:54,  1 user,  load average: 0.47, 0.62, 0.35`
