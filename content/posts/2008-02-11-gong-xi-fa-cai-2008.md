I would like to wish all my Chinese friends and all Malaysians a "Happy and Prosperous Chinese New Year".

I got caught up with a lot of things this weekend including a really bad hangover. I'm back to normal now and would sincerely like to apolagize for my late wishes. Especially to all my close Chinese friends.

Sorry guys, better late then never.
