My must have! Mozilla Firefox extension Feedly is coming to Google's Chrome web browser.

It's currently in preview so don't expect it to be fully functional.Â  If you're feeling adventures and want to take it for a spin simply follow [@feedly_chrome][2] and wait for an invite. Invites are scheduled to start coming out today.
