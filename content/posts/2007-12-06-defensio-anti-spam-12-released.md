The latest update for the Defensio Anti Spam WordPress was released today.

This update fixed all the issues me and other Defensio users were experiencing recently. The previous version broke and caused the plugin editor and theme editor to stop working. Bug Report

I have the latest version installed and running now. So far nothing seems to be broken.
