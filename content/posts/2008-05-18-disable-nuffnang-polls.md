Nuffnang recently launched it's [smart poll][1] feature which enabled polls to be shown together with your campaign ads. Since it's launch I've only seen one poll across all blogs and sites running Nuffnang ads.

It's a cool idea to run polls but till the poll questions increase I'd rather have the polls feature turned off since it's taking up too much real estate.

If you're in the same boat with then the screen shots below might help. A simple walk through to turn off the polls feature.

1. On the main main click the green "More" link.

2. Now click on the green "Blog Manager" link.

3. Select "No" from the POLLS drop down menu.
