Try Googling your name, you'll realize that your Google profile does not show up in the results. Google by default will not release your profile anymore until you have explicitly allowed it to do so.

For those who rather not have their profiles online, you don't have todo anything.The default is to not publish your profile. However, for those wanting to publish your Google profile, head on over to [Google Profiles][1] and search enable your profile.
