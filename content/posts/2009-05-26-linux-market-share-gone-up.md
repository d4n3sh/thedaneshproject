Based on W3Counter&#8217;s April report, Linux&#8217;s market share has grown over the past year to a steady 2.16%. At around the same time last year that value stood at 1.89%.

The number&#8217;s surely to go up as the Linux desktop environment continues to improve with every new release.

I&#8217;m 100% Linux at home now running Ubuntu and openSUSE and I&#8217;m glad to have contrubuted to growth of Linux.
