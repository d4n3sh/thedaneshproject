Based on W3Counter's April report, Linux's market share has grown over the past year to a steady 2.16%. At around the same time last year that value stood at 1.89%.

The number's surely to go up as the Linux desktop environment continues to improve with every new release.

I'm 100% Linux at home now running Ubuntu and openSUSE and I'm glad to have contrubuted to growth of Linux.
