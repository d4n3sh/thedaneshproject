Walk into a store and pick up your favorite original DVD for a rediculas price. Get home, pop it into the DVD player and you'll have to wait about 10 - 20 mins before all the ads, warnings and promos are done.

Pirated DVDs are straightforward. No promos, no warnings, no ads. What you want is what you get.

Which do you prefer?

The pic below speaks for itself.
