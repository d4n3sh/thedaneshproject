A new security release for WordPress is out. This will be an urgent fix as it attentions a flaw found in the XML-RPC implementation. An attacker could easily exploit this vulnerability and gain the ability to edit user posts.

Besides the fix this release also includes a few [bug fixes][2].

I've done my upgrade, have you?

Download the WordPress 2.3.3 [here][3].
