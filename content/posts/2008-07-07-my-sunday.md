Spent my Sunday at [Sunway Lagoon][1] with my office colleagues. My camera was in the locker the whole time so the only moment I managed to capture was Mr. TigerÃ‚Â  on the way out.

Anyways, it was a fun and tiring day and to top it off I fell for a sales trick by Sunway. The wrist band provided had a RM10 refundable deposit on it which I had not idea of. On the way out a sales girl ask me to return the wrist band in exchange for a free watch. What happened to my RM10? Stepping out of the gift store a tour guide walked up to me saying I should have said "no" to the free watch and gone to the ticket counter instead for my RM10. Damn&#8230;&#8230;
