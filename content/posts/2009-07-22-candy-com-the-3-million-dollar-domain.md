Who said common names can&#8217;t sell?

[Candy.com][2] was bought by G&J Holdings for  a whopping USD 3million from the &#8220;Domain King&#8221;,  [Rick Schwartz][3]. WOW!!

What does G&J Holdings do? Nothing but candies. A massive selection, from old to new and they&#8217;re all online. On the downside, they don&#8217;t do international orders.

This si something to note. There&#8217;s no domain too short, too simple, too plain or  too common. If you wait they will come&#8230;&#8230;..
