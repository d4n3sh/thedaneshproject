Who said common names can't sell?

[Candy.com][2] was bought by G&J Holdings for  a whopping USD 3million from the "Domain King",  [Rick Schwartz][3]. WOW!!

What does G&J Holdings do? Nothing but candies. A massive selection, from old to new and they're all online. On the downside, they don't do international orders.

This si something to note. There's no domain too short, too simple, too plain or  too common. If you wait they will come........
