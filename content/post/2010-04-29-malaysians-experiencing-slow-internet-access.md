Malaysians are currently experiencing slow internet access.

The disruption is due to a cable fault on the Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 (SMW4) submarine cable network between Alexandria in Egypt and Palermo in Italy linking Malaysia to Europe and the United States (US).

Restoration work is currently in progress and scheduled to be completed on Sunday, 2nd May.

In the mean time, here&#8217;s a temporary work around. [TmNet Proxy][1]
