My Facebook page has become one giant ball of information. Cluttered and confusing with the increasing amount for new applications being shared and circulated. I&#8217;m quite sure I&#8217;m not alone on this.

Facebook has announced a makeover which is panned for roll out next month. The roll out will happen in stages. The goal is to un-clutter, simplify and organize the mountains for data being moved around over Facebook everyday amongst users.

Facebook has also made available an integration guide for developers over at it&#8217;s wiki.
