Use this tool at [Dynamic Drive][1] to automatically generate all the code needed to protect a directory on your site. Below are the 2 files generated by the tool. .htaccess goes into the folder that you want to protect and .htpasswd should be in a folder not accessible from the web. I normally put my .htpasswd file in my apache&#8217;s base folder.

.htaccess file  
`AuthName "Restricted Area"<br />
AuthType Basic<br />
AuthUserFile /home/mydir/.htpasswd<br />
AuthGroupFile /dev/null<br />
require valid-user`

.htpasswd file  
`danny:8UAaVrlw.58f6`
