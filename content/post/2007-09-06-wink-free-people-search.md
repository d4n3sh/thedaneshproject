Wink let&#8217;s you find people from other social networks like MySpace,Bebo, Friendster and others from one central location. You will need to register a profile at Wink and also register the the social networks you belong to into your Wink profile.

Your people search can be based on name, location,school,work,interest and more&#8230;.

Tools from Wink,

Wink has a Firefox extension that will allow you to directly search for individuals from Firefox and also a widget to integrate into your blog/site.

The Wink widget is similiar to the [ShowYourself][3] widget I introduced in my [previous post][4]. See sample below.
