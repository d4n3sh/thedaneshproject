Apple has announced the release of their second generation iPhone. The launch date for the new iPhone 3G is planned for 11th July 2008. Apple will be launching the new phone [world wide][2] in stages.

Apple has also slashed the price of the new iPhone. USD199 for the 8GB model and USD299 for the 16GB model. This will surely boost Apple&#8217;s market share in the coming months.

iPhone 3G does come with a few goodies under it&#8217;s hood. GPS, full 3G support, App Store, support for Microsoft&#8217;s exchange server, support for more languages and many other enhancements including a scientific calculator.

I&#8217;m still waiting for Google&#8217;s Android before making any decision on what my next phone might be.
