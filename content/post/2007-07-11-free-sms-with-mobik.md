What is Mobik?

Mobik is a community with members from all around the globe. Mobik members can send SMS to each other for free via mobile to mobile or online to mobile.

Mobik also has a reward plan. The goal is to accumulate as much &#8220;K&#8221; (Mobik Currency) as possible by inviting friends, completing surveys and participating in competitions. &#8220;K&#8221; can then be used to redeem cool gadgets like mp3 players and ipods and many others.

Mobk is running of ads so don&#8217;t be suprised to see them. Don&#8217;t worry the ads are mostly non intrusive. For example, after sending and sms your will get a short ad show up withing the sms screen for about 10 seconds or less. Not too bad I say.

[Mobik is free so Join fast to start enjoying the great service.][2]
