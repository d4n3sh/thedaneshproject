For all KDE fans out there like me, KDE 4.0 is out!! It has been 11 years since the beginning but KDE 4.0 now marks the beginning of a new era for the KDE desktop environment. &#8220;New and improved&#8221;

<!--more--> What can you expect?

  * Desktop improvements. Plasma, KRunner, KickOff, and Kwin. [More here][1]
  * Better hardware support and integration through new and improved libraries. Phonon, The Solid Hardware Integration Framework, KHTML, ThreadWeaver, QT4. [More here][2]
  * Much needed beautification all around. Oxygen. [More here][3]
  * New applications to replace and optimize usability and functionality. [More here][4]

The [KDE 4.0 visual guide][5] will give you a better view of what the improvements are and look like. If you need a test drive, there is a live cd based on openSUSE with KDE 4.0 [here][6]. ArkLinux, DEbian, Fedora, Gentoo, Kubuntu and Mandriva are also beginning to distribute KDE 4.0 through new releases and updates.

My NB is gonna look fine with the new KDE 4.0, hopefully.
