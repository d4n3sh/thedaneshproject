Found my first bug in the latest Defensio plugin version 1.1.2. Upon activating the plugin a few things stop working in my WordPress admin section.

1. Can&#8217;t load the Defensio quarantine page from the dash board.

2. Can&#8217;t load the plugin editor anymore.

3. Can&#8217;t load the theme editor anymore.

Once I have the Defension-anti-spam plugin turned off everything is back to normal.

I ain&#8217;t no php specialist so I can&#8217;t operate on the source files but I&#8217;ve submitted a bug report at Defensio&#8217;s Community site in hopes for a quick response.
