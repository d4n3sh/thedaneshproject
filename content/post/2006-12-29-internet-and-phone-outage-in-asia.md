Bet everyone&#8217;s been experiencing slow internet access for the past 2 days. It took me 45mins just to get this post out.

Well anyway, the problem was due to the massive earthquake that hit Taiwan 2days back. The largest telco breakdown Asia has seen in quite some time.

The outage did not just degrade the internet but also phone lines.

More then a dozen submarine fibre lines broke. If it were just a few lines, we would be fine as there would have been sufficient backup bandwidth.
