If you are anything like me then I bet you will be down at the nearest [Starbucks][1] on the 15th of March 2007.

Starbucks will be holding a Coffee Break between 10am and 12pm the that day. Make sure you get there on time to enjoy your cup of coffee.

The Starbucks [CoffeeBreak][2]

> I drink on average 5-8 cups of plain black coffee a day. I love the taste and the effect it has on me.  
> Well, when you only sleep a few hours a day then you will need all the coffee you can find.
