Google&#8217;s a year away from releasing Chrome OS but the code has already been made fully Open Source for the open source community start enjoying today.

Google hosted a Google Chrome OS event today to share their progress so far and the direction they&#8217;re moving in. Also, there&#8217;s demo of Google Chrome OS in action. [Watch the webcast][2].

I&#8217;m excited about Chrome OS. It&#8217;s fast (7 sec boot), it&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s clean, it&#8217;s secure, all your data sits on the cloud and so far the UI looks awesome!

We use the browser and not the OS so why keep the the OS?Â  That&#8217;s Google&#8217;s idea and I&#8217;m loving it so far.

Reality check though, they might just be taking over the world!!
