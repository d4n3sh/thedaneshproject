I missed the debate last night thanks to work. But anyways, here are they videos if you missed them too.

It turned out to be more of a personal attack session then what it was initial intended to be, an open debate. Anwar stood his grounds well with good facts and discreet sarcasms but Shabery was personal insults all the way, blunt.

I know who won.
