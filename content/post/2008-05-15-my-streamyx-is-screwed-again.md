My [Streamyx][2] is screwed again. Actually it&#8217;s been like that for a month now. The speed is nominal in the mornings but after 8pm the speed drops to 1/4 the normal. My last bandwidth test came up with 104.4 Kbits/download and 290Kbits/upload. Looks like someone&#8217;s overselling bandwidth again, you think so? Or could it be a simple port overload?

I reported the case last week and was assigned a case and an engineer. They call me up 1 day later to verify. I said no one showed up, they gave me a number to call. I called and was informed that the engineer should have already attended to me. Further investigation revealed that the engineer never showed up, he excuse was &#8220;there were too many students around the exchange box for me to work on it&#8221;, literally. That was it, I never heard back.

Today, couple of days later I called Streamyx again. To my surprise the agent said my case was resolved and closed. I said &#8220;NO, it&#8217;s still da same&#8221;. We went on again with the normal chat till she finally logged a new case and assigned a new engineer to the case. Also, I was advice to email some screen shots.

See for yourself,

I just want my promised bandwidth. I am a paying customer, is this too much to ask?
