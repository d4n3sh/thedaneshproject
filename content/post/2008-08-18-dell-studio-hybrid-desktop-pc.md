The new Dell Studio Hybrid desktop line is looking pretty slick. Compact form factor packaged within a really cool looking enclosure. O ya, and it&#8217;s ECO friendly with it&#8217;s low power requirements.

In the US the studio PC starts at USD499 for just the CPU but the same options are not available here. There is no option to buy just the CPU here, the starting price is [RM2899][2]. Too bad.

Dell&#8217;sÃ‚Â  finally getting it right I guess. But I feel that we should also have the option to purchase just the CPU. RM2899 is still too pricey for many.
