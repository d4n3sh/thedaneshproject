Not too long ago Facebook introduced [usernames][2]. A feature that made your Facebook profile URL more meaningful. However, at the time Facebook only allowed only one user name change. So if you chose a bad user name like [these people][3] did, you just had to suck it up and live with your mistake.

Fortunately Facebook had a change of mind and now users can change their user name. Changing the user name is done from the &#8220;Account Settings&#8221; page under &#8220;Username&#8221;. However, Facebook is still not opening up the flood gates. You may only change your user name once so make sure to choose wisely this time.

From what I see Facebook has to set a limit on the number of times user name changes are permitted. Spammers would surely abuse the feature if it were left open. What do you think?
