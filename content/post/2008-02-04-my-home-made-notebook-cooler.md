Been having a hard time finding a suitable notebook cooler for me. I&#8217;ve gone through almost all types of coolers available on the market today. Cheapest to the premium priced, single fan to 4 fans, usb powered to adapter powered but yet none did met my standards.

I decided to go ahead and build my own notebook cooler. Played around with acrylic and other materials but what happen was I need to jack my notebook up to get the best air flow. This worked fine while on my lap but not when place on a desk. 

Some hours of thinking later I decided to convert my desk into a cooler itself. Started off drilling a hole fit for a 120mm fan powered by a 12v adapter and connected through a molex connector.

2 hours later I finally found my notebook cooler. Works like a champ!!
