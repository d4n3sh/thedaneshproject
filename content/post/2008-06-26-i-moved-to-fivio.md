It&#8217;s done. DNS records are up to date, mysql synchronized and directory structure intact.

My new hosting provider is Fivio Internet Services.

Why?

Simple, I&#8217;m tired of the big players. Shared hosting users don&#8217;t get the respect they need most times and I&#8217;m not alone on this. Many share my experience.

It&#8217;s time to look elsewhere. Smaller upcoming providers like Fivio will always have their customers taken care of well. It&#8217;s just good business ethics. 

I&#8217;ve had excellent support from them during my move so far and looking forward to a great hosting experience with them.
