Wal-Mart have decided to drop the &#8220;Green gPC&#8221; Linux based low cost desktops from it&#8217;s stores. However the gPC will still be available through [walmart.com][1]

&#8220;_This really wasn&#8217;t what our customers were looking for_,&#8221; said Wal-Mart Stores Inc. spokeswoman Melissa O&#8217;Brien.

Consumers today are not into low end PCs which was the whole idea behind the &#8220;Green gPC&#8221;. Consumers are favoring up to date hardware specs bundled with alternative OS like Linux as seen with [ASUS&#8217;s Eee PC][2] range of products.
