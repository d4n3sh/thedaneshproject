Couple of my pals were asking today about buying the latest iPhone 3G here in Malaysia.

Fortunately a few good business minded souls have popped up around doing just that. The 8GB is going for RM3399 wheres the 16GB model is priced at RM3699 and comes in 2 colors. Black or White.

I would love to get my hands on one but for now the price is way beyond my budget üôÅ . Guess I&#8217;ll have to save up or hope for a kind soul to donate one to me üòÄ

But wait, there is still hope. According to Irwan iPhones 3G from NZ are legally unlocked so there is no violation of the warranty terms. Also, the price floats around RM2500.

Shot a few mails to my pals over at NZ, let&#8217;s see what they say.

Here they are;

1. [iWorld][1] &#8211; One thing&#8217;s for sure, their site is freaking impressive.

2. [iMalaysian][2] &#8211; Price is even higher. RM 4500
