[YouTorrent][2] is the latest torrent search engine to hit the net. What&#8217;s different this time is that YouTorrent&#8217;s searches are real-time, meaning that no torrents files are hosted by YouTorrent but instead it goes out and graps meta information from other [popular torrent search engines][3] out there.

YouTorrent currently works with Mininova, The Pirate Bay, IsoHunt, MyBitTorrent, NewTorrents, SuprNova, Monova, Vuze, BitTorrent, LegitTorrents, SeedPeer , BT Junkie, SumoTorrent. This list will keep growring over time to futher improve YouTerrent&#8217;s reach for torrents.

Enhancements we can expect in the future;

  * Better blog design (naturally!)
  * Information pages (about, help, FAQ .etc)
  * Boolean Searches (support for AND, OR and + &#8211; )
  * Linux Firefox Support
  * Static Cached Results Pages
  * Advanced Search Features
  * Engine Customization Options
  * More Engine Selections
  * Official Firefox Search Plugin

![][5] I am starting to like YouTorrent as the results are real time from multiple sources which saves me loads of time.Ã‚Â  I love to see the search results load in real time. I&#8217;m not alone, in the past 3 days since it&#8217;s launch YouTorrent as received 50,000 unique visits and 150,000 searches.
