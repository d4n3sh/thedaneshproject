The popular BitTorrent tracker [Demonoid][2] was forced to go offline. This time by the [CRIA][3] (Canadian Recording Industry Association).

Demonoid is currently down and below the quoted from there index page.

> The CRIA threatened the company renting the servers to us, and because of this it is not possible to keep the site online. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your understanding.
