It was juat a matter of time before someopne ported Android over to the iPhone.

[Planetbeing][1], iPhone hacker had managed to dual boot an iPhone to run both Android and iPhoneOS.

The video&#8217;s long but intended to walk you thought the whole process. You actually see Linux booting and shit&#8230;

For now it&#8217;s only working with the original iPhone and is still quite buggy. Think about the future ðŸ˜€
