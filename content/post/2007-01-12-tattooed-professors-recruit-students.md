 [Christopher Helland][1], showed up in the recruitments ad for the DALHOUSIE university in Canada. Christoper teaches Sociology and Social Anthropology at the University.

Me tattooed my self and being constantly scrutinized for my love of tattoos to see people opening up like this really lightens up my day.

Times are changing and so must we. It&#8217;s art people!!!

I&#8217;ve never seein an Acedemic ad like this one.
