Mr. Dell will be replacing Kevin Rollins who was the previous CEO and still a close friend of Mr. Dell.  
Read the original announcement here.

**My thoughts;**

Personally I don&#8217;t know what to look forward to in the coming days bit for sure Michael will be moving the company in a forward motion with some good ideas up his sleeve.
