How many search engines plugine do you have added to your Firefox? I have the defaults as Google seems to be the only one I need.

However, if you need more then what Firefox offers out of the box, there are many other search engine plugins available for Firefox. Wikipedia, YouTube, Torrentz, just to name a few.

Currently YouTube is on top with the most downloads. Followed by Dictionary.com, isoHunt and The Pirate Bay.

The [Mycroft][2] project has a list of the top 25 most popular search engine plugins. [Browse the list][3].
