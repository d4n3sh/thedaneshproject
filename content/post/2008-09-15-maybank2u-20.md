The new Maybank2U 2.0 portal is on it&#8217;s way to a browser near you. It&#8217;s not quite launched yet but you can [take it for a spin][2].

It&#8217;s clean, organized and geared for the future. Guess they won&#8217;t have to think about a face lift anytime soon.

They also have a blog going now, all-you M2U. The first bank is Malaysia to do so I guess.

Colin Charles has posted an excelent review of the portal so make sure you check it out at his [blog][3].
