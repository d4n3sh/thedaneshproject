Hi, its me Raja again. This time I talk about [parted][1], an alternative to fdisk for linux. This is my second screencast, so the quality is not there yet. The youtube video somehow seems a little burry, so you may want to look at the higher quality [.avi][2] version.

Anyhow, comments are much appreciated on how to improve this screencast.
