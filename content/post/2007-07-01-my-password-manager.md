I have always been using [KeePass][1] on my notebook as my password manager till recently when I moved back to KL. Read on to find out why.

**The problem;**

I have 3 windows based machines that I use regularly. 2 at home and 1 for the road. They all have access to the net. Firefox with [Google&#8217;s browser sync][2] extension is what I use to keep my bookmarks, urls and forms synchronized between them.

All the login details for my banking sites and secure work sites are stored in my trusty [KeePass][1]. When I get back I normally work on my desktops. I have to export the [KeePass][1] database from my notebook and import it into my into my notebooks and every time I have a new login added I have to repeat the export/import process all over again. This prompted me to start seaching for an alternative solution. Online password managers!!

**The Solutions,**

I found 2 possible solutions. [PassPack][3] and [Clipperz][4] .

<u><strong>PassPack</strong></u>

[PassPack][3] has been around for some time now(Dec 2006). It is feature packed,secure and I love the simple,functional and clean interface. The learning curve needed to get used to [PassPack][3] is almost 0 to none.

**Some of the features that stand out to me are;**

  1. Auto Lock &#8211; [PassPack][3] will automatically save and lock my passwords with the packing key whenever the page if left ideal for 2 minutes.
  2. Anonymous &#8211; I never provided my email addresses.
  3. Password generator &#8211; cool built in password generator.
  4. Scramble &#8211; Scrambles my password field on command when someone is passing by. On by default.
  5. AES &#8211; AES is the encryption method approved by the US Gov.
  6. Import/Export &#8211; Ability to easily import and export my password list. I used this in import from KeyPass.
  7. [PassPack][3] Blog &#8211; Covers everything about [PassPack][3].

I have using [PassPack][3] for a few days now and it&#8217;s awesome!!

<u><strong>Clipperz</strong></u>

[Clipperz][4] is the new kid on the block who is out to give [PassPack][3] a run for it&#8217;s money. It boosts a colorful and simple interface but I feel [PassPack][3] has a simpler interface.

Cool features;

  1. Cool interface &#8211; The interface is simple with a good color scheme.
  2. Direct Logins &#8211; Single sign on. Allows me to log in directly to a site directly provided yo have the site credentials already saved.
  3. Bookmarklet &#8211; I can easily add a new website to my [Clipperz][4].
  4. Anonymous &#8211; No email address require.
  5. Encrypt by browser &#8211; Data is encrypted by my browser before being sent to the [Clipperz][4] servers. [Clipperz][4] only stores my encrypted data.

What&#8217;s lacking;

  1. Import/Export &#8211; No import feature yet. Export only exports to a printable version. I have to use the offline copy feature to save an offline copy.
  2. Mozilla only &#8211; Only mozilla based browsers supported. Mozilla, Sea monkey and Firefox.
  3. Java script &#8211; [Clipperz][4] uses opesource based cryptographic functions. [Read more at Ajaxian][9]. Who will I blame and take to court when my passwords are exploited?
  4. Direct Login &#8211; Honey pot for hackers to reverse engineer? I think so.

[Clipperz][4] is a good tool. They are not quite there yet but I believe with other solutions out there like [PassPack][3] the developrers at [Clipperz][4] will surely push the envelope on futher enhancements.

<u><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between Clipperz and Passkey?</strong></u>

I have made my choice. Sorry [KeePass][1] and [Clipperz][4] but going with [PassPack][3] for now. It has convenience, functionality and security on it&#8217;s side and those are the 3 factors I looked at.

Which will you choose? I suggest all 3 and see which works best for you.
