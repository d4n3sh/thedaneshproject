Almost all corporate users today use notebooks at work. The &#8220;Lenovo ThinkPad&#8221; is a favorite choice. Why? I don&#8217;t know. I at my work place we are all on Lenovo ThinkPads.

Earlier this week Lenovo issued a battery recall program for it&#8217;s ThinkPad R60, R61, T60, T61, X60 and X61 series. The faulty batteries either held only minimum charge or completely stop functioning. Lenovo has come back to ensure the faulty batteries don&#8217;t pose any risk to the end users.

To check if your battery falls into the bad battery list, head on over to Lenovo&#8217;s [battery recall][2] page. Download and run the [Battery Diagnostic Tool][3] to check your battery model, if compromised you will be redirected to another page to initiate the replacement process.
