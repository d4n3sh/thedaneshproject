Google&#8217;s finally out of BETA. Yup, no more &#8220;BETA&#8221; in the their logos.

Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and Google Talk are all now stable products. Both for consumers and enterprise users.

Gmail itself has been in BETA for 5 years. The other aps in Google&#8217;s suite have also done their years in BETA. Come to think of it, it was actually Google (if I&#8217;m not wrong) that started the whole &#8220;BETA&#8221; web 2.0 culture online where almost every service that popped up went public while in BETA and made damn sure that &#8220;BETA&#8221; was part of their logos.

While BETA is good and I love it as it normally means the software is constantly being improved &#8220;work in progress&#8221;, this can sometime scare corp customers away. I understand why, try going to finance and asking for funding to purchase software in &#8220;BETA&#8221;, &#8220;you want me to pay for unfinished software?&#8221; is what you&#8217;d hear. I personally know people who have turned down moving to Google Aps because of it&#8217;s &#8220;BETA&#8221; state.

I don&#8217;t think Google will shift focus away from what it&#8217;s doing now, the &#8220;BETA&#8221; word&#8217;s gone but we won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference. To me it&#8217;s purely a business decision.

Anyways, going out of &#8220;BETA&#8221; potentially means more business for Google. Good for them!!

Question;

Was this done to combat the bad global economy? I don&#8217;t know, what ya think?
