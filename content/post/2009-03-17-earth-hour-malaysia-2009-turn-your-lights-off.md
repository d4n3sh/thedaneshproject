  <span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;">Earth Hour is back this year. It is getting bigger. Well, for those of you who are hearing it for the first time, let me give you a short history on how Earth Hour came about and how the people from all over the world are contributing to it.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">
  <span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;"><span> </span>In 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia (WWF) and the Sydney Morning Herald organized a campaign against global warming. Their campaign was that all the people living in Sydney, inclusive of the corporate sector, switch off all lights for an hour in show of support in the fight against global warming. This was the starting point of Earth Hour and they had decided that it would be helpful during the Global Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. The event managed to reduce electricity consumption during the hour by 10.2 per cent, and nearly 2.5 million people (57 per cent of Sydneyâ€™s population) are believed to have participated. </span></span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
  <span style="color: #000000;"><span lang="EN-US">This campaign did not end there. In 2008, the response and support from people all around the world grew. People from Canada, Japan, Switzerland, America and many more countries participated in this global event. It created awareness in people. We knew that an individual can make a difference when combined with million other individuals around the world who have similar concerns over the climate change.</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span></span>
</p>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
  <span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;">So, once again, Earth Hour 2009 is being held on the 28<sup>th</sup> of March. Many fortune 500 companies, big firms and associations are participating. Schools are encouraged to expose their students to Earth Hour and create the awareness in them. Please do ensure that all lights are switched off on that particular day from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. This year, the goal is to have 1 billion people to switch off their lights. So, please do not hesitate to be part of this historical event. I am sure Mother Nature would accept your token of appreciation!!!! <a href="http://earthhour.org.my/">http://earthhour.org.my</a></span></span>
