Seen this around lately?

Yup, Flickr has gone video now. They don&#8217;t just host your photos anymore but now your videos too. However, Flickr is not here to take over from YouTube. 90 seconds videos and pro users only.

[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-509" title="Flickr Videos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2412204725_5ea04db1ef1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="376" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2412204725_5ea04db1ef1.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2412204725_5ea04db1ef1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />][2]

The Flickr team refers to videos as long photos thus their decision to limit videos to 90 seconds in length. Photos are personal, that&#8217;s what Flickr is. Now with the introduction of video the team feels that personal videos should not exceed 90 seconds to have the best impact.

For now only Flickr Pro account holders can upload videos. However non pro users will be able to view videos uploaded by Pro users unless the videos are marked private.

Candy: Flickr has doubled the upload size of photos. 20MB for Pro users and 10MB for basic users. Get a pro account

A few new video groups on Flickr to get you started. [Video! Video! Video!][3] | Out in the Green | The Video
