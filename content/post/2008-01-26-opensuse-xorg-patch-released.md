openSuse has released the X.Org patch 7.2-143.11.

The patch fixes the [shared memory issue][2] which was causing applications to crash. I fixed my installation by running the [Beta fix 7.2-143.10][3].

I received my update up through the openSUSE updater today and so far everythings been working fine.
