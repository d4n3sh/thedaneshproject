<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœOpen up. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got news for youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢</em></span>, shrieked lil hummingbird outside.

_Ã¢â‚¬ËœGo away. People donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe you after your Ã¢â‚¬ËœRPK on hunger strikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ false alarmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢_, I chided.

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong with you people? Is RPK not eating? Is RPK not in a bad way? Does it matter that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not on strike but possibly avoiding food served him because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerned about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in it? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong with you people?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ </em></span>

Realizing that to-date IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve have yet to win any argument with this pesky bird, I relented and let him in.

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœKarma, just retribution, an eye for an eye, shylockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pound of flesh, call it what you want, but word out there is that in the run-up to the impending takeover by Pakatan, many in the civil service, the police, the judiciary, the prosecution have gone beyond the call of duty to frustrate PakatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s march to Putrajaya.</em></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœThey may not know it but they are all being noted. Lists are being drawn up. A senior civil servants list, a list of senior police officers, a judges list. Lists and more lists.</em></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnd when Pakatan finally gets to Putrajaya, justice will be done.</em></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœA tribunal will be lawfully established to to try these opponents of democracy, these traitors who reneged on their duty to serve the rakyat and instead embroiled themselves in illegalities to pander to their BN masters.</em></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœThey know who they are. Pakatan know too.</em></span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Ã¢â‚¬ËœThey plot now. Pakatan are plotting tooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.</em></span>
