The latest installment to my favorite driving simulator of all time, Grand Turismo 5 will not be out till March 2010.

GT5 was initially rumor/predicted to come out around Christmas time this year but that&#8217;s not going to happen now. Looks like there are going to be many crushed children and driving enthusiast come this Christmas holidays.

The [announcement][2] was made at the Tokyo Game Show.

Sigh&#8230;.
