[Shinjiru][2] is where I&#8217;m hosted. The guys are giving away 500 shared hosting packages at only RM 9.90 . That&#8217;s a 90% price cut on the original RM 99 proce tag. The package comes with 50GB of storage and 5GB /month bandwidth allocation.

However there is a catch, the promotion is only open to those currently hosted with Shinjiru and is limited to 3 purchases per user. But don&#8217;t worry, registered member are allowed to purchase the packages for their friends and family.

If you are interested just drop me a line. I&#8217;ll see if I can help.
