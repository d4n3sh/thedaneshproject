Running Ubuntu 9.04? Need a cool new wallpaper to go with it?

Hong Kiat published a good selection of Ubuntu Wallpapers a few days back. The selection&#8217;s pretty good actually.

Quite sure took them some time to put the collection together.Â  [Check it out.][1]

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1435" title="ubuntu_wallpaper_11" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/ubuntu_wallpaper_11.jpg" alt="ubuntu_wallpaper_11" width="500" height="375" /> 

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1434" title="3d_ubuntu_10" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/3d_ubuntu_10.jpg" alt="3d_ubuntu_10" width="500" height="312" />
