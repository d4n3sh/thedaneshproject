Well, looks like Google influence is everywhere today. Just look at the latest offering from designer [Satya Paul][2]. Satya Paul is known for his new age and dynamic designs. The web 2.0 of the fashion world you could say.

The sari seen above actually says Oogle and not Google but the search results that fill the sari surely is convincing.

Hopefully Google doesn&#8217;t get ideas to start making uniforms for Indian woman now.
