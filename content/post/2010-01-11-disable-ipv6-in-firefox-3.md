Firefox 3 by default resolves IPv6 address first and if that fails then reverts to IPv4. This can sometimes slow down your browser&#8217;s performance.

Here are the steps to turn off IPv6 support in Firefox 3 and above.

1. Key in &#8220;about:config&#8221; into address bar, this will take you to the config page.

2. Key in &#8220;network.dns.disableIPv6&#8221;Â  into the filter bar and hit enter.

3. Right click on the line that read &#8220;network.dns.disableIPv6&#8221; and select the &#8220;Toggle&#8221; option. This will switch the value from &#8220;false&#8221; to &#8220;true&#8221;

4. Restart the browser and enjoy the improvement.
