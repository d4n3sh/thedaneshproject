I am currently hosted at [godaddy][1]. My subscription ends in 2 months so the time to scout for a new hosting company has begin. This time I&#8217;m going for a local hosting provider if possible. Maybe it&#8217;s the idea of my blog being close to home, I don&#8217;t know.

Anyways, this is what I have narrowed down to so far.

If you know of others good reliable hosting companies please do share them.
