openSUSE 11.1, set to be the best release will be relased at **9pm Malaysian time** or [Thursday, December 18, 2008 at 13:00:00 UTC time][1] today. Find a openSUSE 11.1 launch party near you and get update on their [Facebook page][2].

To download go to <http://software.opensuse.org> (don&#8217;t hammer the openSUSE wiki!). Also, if you download within the first 30 hours your download will be serviced by Akamai mirrors which are normally super fast.
