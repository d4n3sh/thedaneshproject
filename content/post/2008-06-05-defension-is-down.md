[Defensio][2] has been down since yesterday.

[<img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/defensio-down-499x144.png" alt="Defensio Down" title="Defensio Down" width="499" height="144" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-597" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/defensio-down-499x144.png 499w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/06/defensio-down.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" />][3]

My spam aren&#8217;t being filtered, I can&#8217;t access my Defensio quarantine page and users are unable to post new comments.

Their hosting provider [Amazon (EC2)][4] push some software which caused Defensio&#8217;s services to go down. The team&#8217;s currently working on the issue and updated can be tracked through their [blog][5] and twitter.
