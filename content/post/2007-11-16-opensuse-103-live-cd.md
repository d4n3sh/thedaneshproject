openSUSE 10.3 is now available in the form of live cd. Both the KDE and GNOME live cds contain the same software as the single cd installation versions. Both are distributed in 32bit versions and only available in US english.

openSUSE is currently my favorite desktop distro due it&#8217;s speed, clean interface and superb community support. The [openSUSE official site][2] andÃ‚Â  [openSUSE community][3] wiki both have an abandonce of articles to help you setupÃ‚Â  and configure your perfect openSUSE desktop.

Give it a spin, try one of the live cd. You don&#8217;t have to install so there is nothing to worry about.
