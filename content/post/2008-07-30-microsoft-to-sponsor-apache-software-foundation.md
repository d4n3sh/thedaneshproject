Microsoft has announced that it will sponsor ASF &#8220;Apache Software Foundation&#8221;. Yahoo and Google are already on board.

Microsoft was quick to say that they will not ditch IIS as tremendous work is constantly being put into it. IIS 8 is already in development and native support for PHP is on the todo list.

As quated from MS;

> **Open Specification Promise**: Microsoft is putting a wide range  
> of protocols that were formerly in the Communications Protocol Program  
> under the Open Specification Promise (OSP). This guarantees their  
> freedom from any patent claims from Microsoft now or in the future, and  
> includes both Microsoft-developed and industry-developed protocols.
