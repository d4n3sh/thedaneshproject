Let&#8217;s face it, Nowadays we&#8217;re always too busy to visit our folks. I&#8217;m guilty of the same crime üôÅ

I stumbled on to &#8220;See You Folks&#8221; today. Put together by 4 guys under 24 hours with the goal to raise awareness about death.

Give it your parent&#8217;s location, age and average visits and you&#8217;ll know how many more times you&#8217;ll get to visit your parent before they are gone for good. You might be shocked by the answer.
