  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">The consortium, which TM is a member of, is still fervently working towards the full restoration of the submarine cables affected by the incident. The consortium has duly informed us that the current bad weather conditions in the affected area are delaying the restoration works in progress. The extensive works undertaken by the consortium include laying new cables as many are experiencing high tension on them; and additional repair works are needed to be performed on several cables damaged by fishing hooks. </span>
