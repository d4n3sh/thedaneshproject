Yup, Hello world again. This time it is final.

I decided to move &#8220;TheDaneshProject Tech Blog&#8221; up a level to just &#8220;TheDaneshProject&#8221;. It&#8217;s easier to remember and seems to be stronger brand name I think. Don&#8217;t youÂ  agree?

I am concentrating more on Linux related reads, general tech and also my passion for tattoos and piercings. This time I am going to try publishing as much information as I can get my hands on from the local scene here in Malaysia. Tattoos and piercings in Malaysia will also be my major direction.

Currently I am working on moving over my old articles from &#8220;TheDaneshProject Tech Blog&#8221; to this blog. Having some issues with the images and comments but I think I&#8217;ll have it completed by the weekend.

Stay tuned guys&#8230;..
