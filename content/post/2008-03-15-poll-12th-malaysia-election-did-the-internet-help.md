Information Minister Datuk Seri Zainuddin Maidin aka Zam seems to think otherwise. According to him the Malaysian citizens only believe in the mainstream media, our one-sided news shows and newspapers and alternative media like the internet, blogs, mobile phones and other new age communication media had nothing to do with the shocking outcome witnesed during our recent election.

What do you think,Ã‚Â  did the Internet & Blogs Influence The Election Results? [Vote here][1].

Watch his idiotic video.
