FreeBSD Jails &#8211; Lightweight Visualization

If your limited processing power is preventing you from running full virtualized environments then this might just be what you need. The basic idea is to have individual jailed environments which have their own Ip address all share the same kernel.

The talk will cover the basics of setting up and running jailed environments on FreeBSD.
