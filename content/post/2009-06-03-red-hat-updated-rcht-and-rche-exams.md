Thinking about getting your RHCT/RHCE certification soon? read up.

Red Hat has started rolling out new exam structures for the RHCE and RCHT certifications starting 1st May 2009.

RHCE is now a single session lasting 3,5 hours. The old exam sturcture had 2 sections lasting 2.5 and 3 hours.

RHCT isÂ  also a single session now, lasting 2 hours. Previously, it was made up of 2 sections lasting 1 and 2 hours.

Been thinkning of renewing my RHCE from RHEL 4 to RHEL 5. Know any good training centres?
