Finally managed to upgrade to WordPress 2.3.1 today. Needed quite a few tweaks here and there but everything seems to be holding togather now.

Over the next week I&#8217;ll be fine tuning the functionality side of things so expect to see some errors. Learning the whole new Tags phenomenon now ðŸ™‚

For now these are the plug ins I have running on my shiny new WordPress installation.

  2. [Cforms II][3]
  3. [Defensio Anti-Spam][4]
  4. FeedBurner FeedSmith
  5. [Get Recent Comments][5]
