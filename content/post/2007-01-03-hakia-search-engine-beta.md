<img id="image24" alt="hakia" src="/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/hakia.jpg" />A new &#8220;meaning-based search engine&#8221;.

That&#8217;s what hakia is. No more indexing as we do it today. hakia works more like the human brain &#8220;Cognition&#8221;.  
hakia&#8217;s scheduled it&#8217;s full launch in 2007.
