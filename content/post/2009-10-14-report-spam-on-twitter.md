@spam was how twitter initial kept track of those pesky spammers. Now, they launched the official &#8220;report spam&#8221; feature.

To report someone as spam, simple go to their profile and click the &#8220;report [usename] for spam&#8221; link. This will prevent them from messaging or following you.

All reported accounts will get forwarded to Twitter&#8217;s officials for review before getting banned.

The process to report has been simplified.Just by doing that, users are now more empowered to keep spammers at bay.

This is good, I&#8217;ve been getting spammed like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. Can&#8217;t wait to start clicking that link ðŸ˜€
