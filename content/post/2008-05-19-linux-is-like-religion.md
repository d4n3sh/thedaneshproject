Linux to me is like religion. Even though I am not religious but I feel that Linux in some way is like religion. It&#8217;s free, goes by many different names, it&#8217;s changes over time to suit needs but ultimately it&#8217;s personal.

There will never be one &#8220;ultimate distribution&#8221;. It will always be a personal choice for the end user.

I love openSUSE, my hardcore Linux friends love Debian and BSD. Many others love Fedora but then a few prefer Ubuntu. It&#8217;s individual.
