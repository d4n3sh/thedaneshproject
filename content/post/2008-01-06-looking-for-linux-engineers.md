My cousin is urgently looking for Linux engineers to fill open positions for the broadcasting company he works for.

They are looking for candidates with Linux and Cisco experience. Best of all, chance to work in Dubai!! Yes, my cousin himself is currently based there but is missing his family back here and wants to come back.

The company is current working on multiple projects and needs more engineers.

For those interested please [contact me][1]. Malaysians only guys.

[Abi][2] also has an opening for a [SMB Sales Consultant at Hp][3]
