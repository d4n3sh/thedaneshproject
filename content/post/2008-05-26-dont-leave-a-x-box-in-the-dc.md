When forced to work within a limited budget you are normally forced to come up with alternative cost saving solutions. This was the case for a University which desided to use a Linux powered X-Box to host it&#8217;s students web projects.

As time passed so did the personnel who knew about the X-Box web server. Without proper handover documents and asset management the X-Box server soon gets forgotten.

One day a new guy comes in an sees a X-Box sitting on the shelve all alone and decides to take it home for his kid. What happened next was, students started calling up reporting their server was down. Oooops!!

The X-box server is tracked down and labeled &#8220;This is a server&#8221; and the day is saved.
