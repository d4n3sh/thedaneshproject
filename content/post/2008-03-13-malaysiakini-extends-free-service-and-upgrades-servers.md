Malaysiakini is extending it&#8217;s [free service][2] till this Friday 14th March. However after that it will be switching back to it&#8217;s subscribers-only model. [Malaykini.tv][3] their video site will also be transitioning to a subscriber-only model due to the high cost of bandwidth. Lower resolution videos will however still be uploaded into [YouTube][4] as they have always been.

Much needed upgrades are also being put in place. Malaysiakini will be seeing 3 new high-end servers and have it&#8217;s bandwidth upgraded to 150mbps. Users will surely realize an improvement in performance moving forward.

Malaysiakini and many other local news sites experienced a tremendous spike in users/subscribers this past week thanks to the [Malaysia 12th general elections][5]. I myself experienced 12k page views within a few hours.

This just comes to show the awareness levels of Malaysians, almost everyone I know is internet savvy now, even my dad 63 years old now spends 6 hours a day on the net researching. Many politicians (Non net savvy I guess) consider the Net (alternative media) a bad thing and claim that almost everything if not all is not true. But one must ask, why aren&#8217;t they coming out with their own sites/blogs to counter the negative media. An open debate I would call it(the democratic way). [Watch a video][6].

I still buy newspapers today but since I feel that the local papers and news channels are generally pro government, I need to hear both sides of a story. Where do I go? The online world/community is the answer to satisfy my &#8220;need to know&#8221; hunger. However one must not easily believe everything one reads online or from the papers. Always cross reference before coming to a conclusion. Find the truth and not blindly follow.

Malaysians are smart people, don&#8217;t keep challenging them. serve the people and your country not just your party.
