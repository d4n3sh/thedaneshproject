Wonder how your friends checkin in &#8220;Off The Grid&#8221; in [FourSquare][1]?

Simple, when you check in using your mobile device make sure all share options are not selected. Don&#8217;t share with your friends, don&#8217;t post to twitter and don&#8217;t post to FB.

That&#8217;s it. Tell me if it works for you.
