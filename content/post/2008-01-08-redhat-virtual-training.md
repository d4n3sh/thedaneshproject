Don&#8217;t have access to RedHat certified training centers or just fancy studying with the comforts of your own home? Which ever your choice maybe, RedHat has the answer for you.

Readhat&#8217;s latest offering, Virtual Training is live, instructor led and best of all _**online.**_ The courses are conducted by RedHat certified instructors and feature the same content you would receive in the standard classroom sessions. The virtual classes will be thought in 4 hours incremental sessions which should provide your brain sufficient time to rest and wonder.

Currently the cources provided are;

  * [RH033VT Red Hat Linux Essentials][1]
  * [RH131VT Red Hat Linux System Administration  
][2] 

courses planned for the future;

  * RH253VT Red Hat Linux Networking and Security Administration
  * RH301VT RHCE Rapid Track Course

Something I thought you might find interesting. There are currently 27,500 RedHat Certified Engineers (RHCE),Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  18,500 RedHat Certified TechniciansÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  (RHCT) andÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  46,000 RedHat CertifiedÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  ProfessionalsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  around the globe.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Nothing when compared to Microsoft&#8217;s certified engineers but it does help keep the Linux engineer&#8217;s salary high. ğŸ˜‰
