Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox 3.5 RC3 is out. [Download Firefox RC3][2]

Hopefully it&#8217;s the last release candidate before Firefox 3.5 goes public. From what I&#8217;ve heard the release date is set for next week, start of July.

The [video][3] below, by Mike Beltzner gives a quick preview of whatâ€™s new and exciting in Firefox 3.5.

Also, check out the [demos][4] to see what Firefox 3.5 is capable of.

Take release candidate for a spin, you&#8217;ll realize it&#8217;s much faster compared to the previous versions of the browser. However, remember that it&#8217;s not the final product. Some extensions might not work and you might run into a few bugs.
