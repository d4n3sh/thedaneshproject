Panasonic introduced the world largest HD Plasma TV at [CES][2] this year.

The Plasma TV is 150-inches across which is roughly what you would get when 9 50-inch TVs are put together. It has an effective viesing distance of 11 feet which prevents it from ever getting into an apartment. Imagine how much head movement would be needed if it was any closer then 11 feet from you. As of now Panasonic has not released the cost for this baby.

The next closes TV in the market today weighs in at 103-inch and has a price tag of RM220,000. Saw one in [Suria KLCC][3] the other day.
