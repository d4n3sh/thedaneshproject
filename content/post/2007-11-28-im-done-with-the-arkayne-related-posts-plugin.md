It&#8217;s been over 24 hours since I activated my Arkayne Related Posts plugin but no related posts have even shown up so far. I expected 30 mins as stated by Arkayned eventually 24 hours later and nothing is happening.

I sent 4 mails asking for support but never heard back from Arkayne.

Apparently the Arkayne Related plugin is not working as advertised. The only thing left to do now is to drop the plugin. Till then I&#8217;m back to [Simple Tags&#8217;s][2] related posts feature.

I love the concept behind Arkayne and hope they get it running soon.
